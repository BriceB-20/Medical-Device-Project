        "During the last decade, health care delivery has seen the introduction of ever more sophisticated and complex equipment. This means that the medical devices first used in critical and high dependency care units are now integral requirements in the delive ry of direct patient care in acute ward areas. Registered nurses are the primary users of such medical devices (McConnell 1995). This paper reports on a comparative pilot questionnaire study undertaken in one acute NHS Trust. The main aim of the study was to compare, identify and consider the issues which relate to the education of registered nurses (whether employed by hospital Trusts or nurse Banks) in the use of medical devices. The paper outlines primary findings concerning what UK registered nurses learn about the medical devices that they use in the direct care of patients, and the consequences of their use. The results will assist clinical and educational staff to identify the specific strengths and weaknesses within current education provision, which prepares nurses in the use of medical devices. In light of the results, appropriate evidence-based educational and training strategies can be designed or modified to address clinical governance and risk management issues.",

        "How to eradicate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization in hospitalized patients is uncertain. We reviewed our experience with MRSA decolonization therapy in hospitalized patients.\nAn 1100-bed, university-affiliated tertiary care teaching hospital in Toronto, Ontario.\nRetrospective chart review of 207 adult inpatients with MRSA colonization hospitalized between February 1996 and March 1999.\nAll patients with MRSA colonization were assessed for possible decolonization therapy with a combination of 4% chlorhexidine soap for bathing and washing, 2% mupirocin ointment applied to the anterior nares three times/day, rifampin (300 mg twice daily) and either trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (160 mg/800 mg twice daily) or doxycycline (100 mg twice daily). This treatment was given for seven days.\nA total of 207 hospitalized patients with MRSA colonization were identified and 103 (50%) received decolonization therapy. Patients who received decolonization therapy were less likely than untreated patients to have intravenous (P=0.004) or urinary catheters (P<0.001), or extranasal sites of colonization (P=0.001). Successful decolonization was achieved in 90% of the 43 patients who were available for at least three months of follow-up.\nCombined topical and oral antimicrobial therapy was found to be effective in eradicating MRSA colonization in selected hospitalized patients, especially those without indwelling medical devices or extranasal sites of colonization.",

        "The problems of application of pulse wave signals in electrical bioimpedance analyzers foreseen for using in implantable medical devices as diagnostical means are discussed in this paper. The main problem arises at measurement of phasor parameters by the aid of rectangular pulse wave signals. The specific measurement errors appear due to presence of higher harmonics in the spectra of pulse waveforms. These errors are discussed in two cases, in the case of full cycle rectangular waveform, and in the case of using the shortened pulses introduced specially for reduction of errors.",

        "This paper reviews the leadership styles and business models found in small technologically based businesses operating in the healthcare sector within one of the UK regions, the East Midlands. The most frequently encountered business model strands were 1) mixed economies: that fund development with service income; cross-sectoral product portfolios; and decoupled business portfolios led by a single entrepreneur and 2) scale sensitive \"stay small\" models including the avoidance of venture capital; \"early exit\"; and virtual business strands. There was found to be little correlation between leadership style and business model for the small number of businesses surveyed. The avoidance of venture capital is in direct contrast to adjacent regions.",
        "It's quite a rollercoaster ride when you are part of a medical device start-up team. There are often many partners and processes that are not often taught in school or in the training to do research .

        "Electromagnetic interference (EMI) to critical care medical devices has been reported by various groups. Previuos studies have demonstrated that infusion and syringe pumps are susceptible of false alarm buzzing and block, when exposed to various EMI sources. Whether these events may have clinical relevance is still debated. The risk of EMI depends on several factors such as phone emitted power, distance and carrier frequency. We investigated the EMI on infusion and siringe pumps from GSM phones at various distances and emitted powers. Malfunctions were observed in 4/7 infusion pumps and 1/4 syringe pumps exposed to mobiles at their maximum output, for distances as long as 30 cm. The maximum power not inducing any malfunction even at 0 cm distance was also determined. The selection of a proper maximum power class reduces significantly the risk of EMI. Such a function is already built in the GSM standard and thus represents one of the feasible solutions to the EMI problem in hospitals.",

        "Engineers have long been aware of Murphy's Law: If anything can go wrong, it will. When applied to medical device design, Murphy's Law indicates that if there is a way that a medical device can be set up incorrectly then someday, somewhere it will be set up incorrectly. In the clinical environment the result may be patient injury or death. Despite this received wisdom, clinical engineers continue to encounter examples of medical device design that invite users to do the wrong thing, with potentially harmful results. This paper focuses on electrical and other connectors incorporated into medical device designs. Examples of potential and actual misconnections, from the earliest days of clinical engineering to the present, are presented and discussed.",
        "This research is motivated by the rapid pace of medical device and information system integration. Although the ability to interconnect many medical devices and information systems may help improve patient care, there is no way to detect if incompatibilities between one or more devices might cause critical events such as patient alarms to go unnoticed or cause one or more of the devices to become stuck in a disabled state. Petri net tools allow automated testing of all possible states and transitions between devices and/or systems to detect potential failure modes in advance. This paper describes an early research project to use Petri nets to simulate and validate a multi-modality central patient monitoring system. A free Petri net tool, HPSim, is used to simulate two wireless patient monitoring networks: one with 44 heart monitors and a central monitoring system and a second version that includes an additional 44 wireless pulse oximeters. In the latter Petri net simulation, a potentially dangerous heart arrhythmia and pulse oximetry alarms were detected.",
        "Managing medical equipments is a formidable task that has to be pursued maximizing the benefits within a highly regulated and cost-constrained environment. Clinical engineers are uniquely equipped to determine which policies are the most efficacious and cost effective for a health care institution to ensure that medical devices meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and performance. Part of this support is a strategy for preventive and corrective maintenance. This paper describes an alternative scheme of OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) service contract for medical equipment that combines manufacturers' technical support and in-house maintenance. An efficient and efficacious organization can reduce the high cost of medical equipment maintenance while raising reliability and quality. Methodology and results are discussed.",
        "Mobile medical devices, such as infusion pumps, provide an important therapeutic function. They are also valuable sources of information about treatment patterns at the point of care. However, these mobile devices have been independent islands of valuable information, unable to share the data they gather with other hospital information resources on a real time basis. Although data from these devices can provide significant improvements for medical safety and vital information needed for clinical best practice development, gathering that data poses significant challenges when interfacing with hospital information systems. Mobile medical devices move from place to place as independent actors, raising a series of security and identification issues when they need to be disconnected and reconnected using traditional tethered cable connections. The continuing lack of accepted communications protocol standards, in spite of the concentrated efforts of organizations like the IEEE and the Medical Information Bus (IEEE 1073) to establish them, has made integration into the hospital information system a complex and non-standard task. The rapid spread in availability and adoption of high-speed 802.11 wireless systems in hospitals offers a realistic connectivity solution for mobile medical devices. Inspite of this, the 802.11 standard is still evolving, and current security methods designed for user-based products like PDAs and laptop computers are not ideal for unmanned mobile medical devices because they assume the availability of a human operator to authenticate a wireless session. In the absence of accepted standards, manufacturers have created practical and innovative solutions to support the collection of clinical data from mobile medical devices and the integration of that data with hospital information systems. This paper will explore the potential benefits of integrating mobile medical devices into the hospital information system, and describe the challenges in developing connectivity for such system based on actual experience with the implementation of wired, wireless, and hybrid systems in active medical environments.",
        "The continuous treatment of chronic diseases such as heart diseases, pulmonary disease and diabetes, relies on the patient's self-monitoring. The rapid advance in the development of telemedicine systems and monitoring devices during last years gave several solutions in continuous patient telemonitoring. However, in most of the cases, these systems work with only one or a few types of medical devices and, thus, the variety of diseases they can monitor is rather limited. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that medical device manufacturers usually develop their own proprietary communication protocols and data format for each device. Most of the existing telemonitoring systems support communication with limited medical device types and depend on the manufacturer of them. We describe a modular and ambulatory telemedicine platform, the e-Vital platform, where different monitoring devices are being integrated in homecare and telemonitoring service chain, in order to increase patients' quality of life and their feeling of safety concerning their health.",
        "Antibiotic therapy of deep-seated staphylococcal infections, especially when they are associated with foreign implants, such as orthopedic prostheses and permanently inserted catheters, is a difficult challenge. Semi-synthetic penicillins, glycopeptides and quinolones are found effective when given prophylactically in clinical and experimental trials of implant-related infections, but are frequently poorly effective after implant-related infections are established. Thus, removal of the medical devices is often required to obtain cure. The failure of antibiotic therapy to cure staphylococcal foreign body infections may arise from a broad-spectrum phenotypic tolerance to different classes of antimicrobial agents, whose molecular basis and physiological mechanisms are poorly understood.",
        "This review describes important examples of recent nosocomial infection epidemics.

Increased attention should be focused on outbreak investigations in these areas.",
        "Surface-tension-driven blood flow into a capillary tube, as in some medical devices, is studied. In a previous article, we considered the early stages of the entry flow from a drop of blood into a capillary, and solved the problem analytically under the assumption that the resistance of the air is negligible. In the present note we consider a capillary tube of finite length, with the far end containing a small window which opens to the atmosphere. The dynamic reverberation of the air in the capillary tube is analyzed in conjunction with the dynamics of the blood. Existing computing programs are used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. The interface is characterized by the surface tension between the blood and the air, and the contact angle at the triple point where the air-blood interface meets the capillary tube wall. The results tell us how good our earlier simplified analysis is. The new numerical results show that the smaller the window, the larger is the effect of aerodynamic reverberation. However, even for a window as small as 4% of the capillary cross section, and located at the end of the capillary, the difference of the time of arrival of the interface at the window is less than 5%.",

        "Understanding the behaviour of implantable medical devices is of obvious importance. The potential for failure of a medical device can often be associated with issues related to cyclic loading of the device, and material fatigue. Detailed finite element simulations to evaluate the fatigue of stents allow the engineer to assess potential failures. The engineer can then use the analysis results to modify the design and prevent failure, without making and testing numerous physical devices. Complete understanding of the mechanical behaviour of a stent provided by finite element analysis has the benefits of facilitating effective design, helping to reduce time to market and minimising the potential for unwanted failures.",

This paper outlines some of the unique challenges of HRQL research and makes recommendations for assuring that claims are based on the results of rigorous studies designed and conducted according to accepted scientific principles and practices. Standards of evidence for HRQL are discussed in terms of research design and methodology, instrumentation, statistical analysis, and interpretation. Examples are provided to highlight important points. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future trends in HRQL outcomes evaluation.",
        "Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are the third most common nosocomial infections. Catheters and other medical devices are the first exogenous causes of preventable infections in hospital. The estimated attributable mortality for catheter-associated BSI ranges from 1-35%, mainly depending on etiological agents and underlying disease. In considering this, it is necessary to reduce central venous catheter- (CVC)-related BSI prevalence and to obtain a rapid and accurate method for an early diagnosis. This review indicates the advantages and the disadvantages of old and new tools for the early diagnosis of CVC-related BSIs.",
        "Enterococci are gram-positive bacteria that are part of the normal human intestinal flora and can colonize the upper respiratory tract, biliary tract and vagina of otherwise healthy people. Although their virulence is relatively low, recently enterococci have emerged as significant nosocomial pathogens and are currently the 4th leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, including those associated with intravascular catheter and biliary stent implants. The frequent use of these medical devices is often associated with severe complications, including catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) and biliary stent occlusions, because of microbial biofilm formation on the device surface. Furthermore, other than a high level of resistance to penicillin, ampicillin and aminoglycosides, a dramatic increase in vancomycin resistance of enterococci has been recently observed in most clinical settings. Clinical strains exhibiting novel mechanisms of acquired resistance to antimicrobials are frequently isolated. In addition, enterococci have a great ability to transmit these resistance traits to other species and even to other genera. Due to their associated morbidity and mortality, enterococcal infections related to medical devices currently represent a major challenge for clinicians, especially for the management of critically ill patients, resulting in prolonged hospitalization and additional health costs.",
        "Gastroparesis is the most severe form of gastric neuromuscular dysfunction along a continuum that encompasses gastric visceral hypersensitivity, gastric dysrhythmias, and pylorospasm. Gastroparesis may present with vague dyspepsia symptoms or with vomiting of undigested food and weight loss. A careful history and physical examination may suggest the diagnosis of gastroparesis, but symptoms associated with gastric neuromuscular disorders are non-specific. Gastroparesis in patients with diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, is more common than appreciated. If gastroparesis is confirmed, then reversible causes such as mechanical obstruction of stomach and chronic mesenteric ischemia must be excluded. ''Idiopathic'' gastroparesis may follow viral infections or be due to degenerative processes that affect gastric enteric neurons, smooth muscle, and/or interstitial cells of Cajal. An approach to the diagnosis and treatment of gastroparesis and gastric neuromuscular disorders is reviewed including dietary counselling and new medical devices.",
        "Penile prosthesis infections are a devastating complication for both patient and surgeon. Efforts to reduce the risk of infection from these elective procedures are a major focus of research and development by the major prosthesis companies. The Titan inflatable penile prosthesis (Mentor Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA) is coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), a hydrophilic substance that reduces bacterial adherence and absorbs and elutes the antibiotics the device is immersed in intraoperatively. The Titan device was introduced to the American market in September 2002. This study reports the 1-year experience in the U.S. with the Titan and compares infection rates with the noncoated Alpha-1 IPP made by Mentor.\nTwo thousand three hundred and fifty-seven Titan prostheses were implanted in the U.S. from September 2002 to August 2003, compared with the 482 noncoated Alpha-1 IPPs implanted over the same time period. Infection rates were compared, along with bacterial culture data. All data were collected from Mentor's internal database, as generated from the FDA's mandatory reporting of explanted medical devices, and available on the internet.\nThe infection rate for the coated Titan IPP was 1.06% (25/2,357). During the same time period, the infection rate for the Alpha-1 noncoated prosthesis was 2.07% (10/482). Staphylococcus species predominated in both groups (9/25 Titan, 6/10 Alpha-1).\nAt 1 year of follow-up, the data demonstrate that the hydrophilic coating on the Titan IPP confers a significant advantage in reducing the rate of infection over the noncoated device. Long-term follow-up on this first year database is needed before this innovation is accepted as the standard of care for prosthetic surgery. Nevertheless, the theoretical reduction in bacterial adhesion conferred by the hydrophilic PVP surface and the ability to choose which antibiotic the device is immersed in intraoperatively gives the implanting surgeon distinct advantages with this new product.",

        "We report about a fatality during patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Piritramide peripheral blood concentration was measured with 0.1 mg/l and exceeded the normal therapeutic range. Therefore, a fatal overdose was considered as the cause of death with respiratory depression as the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. The tissue distribution was studied; highest concentrations of piritramide were measured in kidney, bile and urine. Due to a large volume of distribution a difference in the drug concentration found in heart and peripheral bloods the phenomenon of drug redistribution was observed. Confronted with toxicological results, investigations revealed, that the PCA pump had been changed during a previous servicing from displaying mg/h to ml/h, therefore, the anesthetist had entered \"1.5\" assuming mg/h, but actually applying 1.5 ml/h (which was therefore equivalent to 2.25 mg/h, given a concentration in the cartridge of 1.5 mg piritramide/ml). In total, 61.5 ml (instead of 61.5 mg) had been infused, equivalent to 92.25 mg piritramide. This case report is a further example that human errors can play a crucial role in the safety of medical equipment. Experts in anesthesia recommended human factors engineering design principles to improve the safety of medical devices.",
        "The concept underlying photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the use of light-absorbing molecules which, when delivered to target cells, and activated by irradiation with light of the appropriate wavelength, produce reactive oxygen species that cause cell death by apoptosis or necrosis. Classically, photodynamic agents have been macrocycles and, as such, application is limited to topical and intravenous administration. In the latter case, reliance has been placed on the characteristic behavior of the photodynamic agents in showing some degree of selectivity for concentrating in the target to minimize non-specific damage to the host tissue. The parameters open to development of improved drugs are: (i) the design of the photodynamic agent molecule as a means of determining the wavelength of light for activation, and for influencing physicochemical characteristics and the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug; (ii) the delay between administration and activation; (iii) the nature of the activating light source; and, (iv) the duration and intensity of the activating light. Obviously, PDT is attractive for treating disease states in which natural apoptotic mechanisms are compromised, specifically for cancerous states and in cases of uncontrolled cell proliferation. PDT also has immunomodulatory sequelae, including triggering of T-cell mediated activity against residual cancerous cells. The use of PDT is being extended to diverse, related immune and proliferative disease states, and to the inactivation of bacteria and viruses. Increasingly, attention is being given to improving treatment by targeting conjugates and local delivery strategies, as well as by the design of photodynamic agents with closely defined photophysical and physicochemical properties. Progress is being made in challenging indications, such as the treatment of solid and pigmented tumors. Alternative technologies not involving light activation are available for some molecules which may also be used with light activation. Some ex vivo techniques and medical devices have been reported.",

        "A human factors evaluation was conducted to inform hospital procurement decision-making in selecting a general-purpose infusion pump to be used hospital-wide. Three infusion pumps from different vendors were involved in the evaluation, which consisted of two phases: a human factors heuristic assessment of the pumps according to several criteria, and user testing in five clinical areas. The clinical areas were: Oncology, Medical/Surgical, Pediatric, ICU, and Anaesthesiology. Fourteen nurses and three anaesthetists participated in the user testing. Reasonable agreement was observed between results of both phases of the evaluation, and overall results clearly favoured one of the infusion pumps over the others. It is recommended that a human factors evaluation should be performed to influence all hospital procurement decisions when purchasing medical devices, to ensure the best devices are selected for the end users and to ultimately enhance patient safety.",
        "In 2001 the Working Group (WG) \"Safety\" was created within the European COST Action B14 \"Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy\" with the main objectives to elaborate recommendations of good practice for hyperbaric medicine and to follow the European normalisation process of hyperbaric chambers. During three years of preparation of the European Code of Good Practice (ECGP) for HBO, the relevant documents concerning safety in hyperbaric chambers from each European country have been revised. The initial document drew on the BHA \"Health and Safety for Therapeutic Hyperbaric Facilities: A Code-of Practice\" (2000), and later on it was modified using national regulations and standards (from Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain), as well as European Norms and existing experience from experts of hyperbaric centres, committees, professional and scientific associations. The ECGP for HBO consists of chapters dedicated to staffing (including responsibilities, competencies and education, minimum team during hyperbaric sessions, fitness and health surveillance), equipment, gas supply, risk management and procedures (including standard and emergency operating procedures, maintenance, record keeping, and patient safety). It also includes ECHM Educational and Training Standards for the Staff of Hyperbaric Centres (1997), ECHM Recommendation for Safety in Multiplace Medical Hyperbaric Chambers (1998), as well as COST B14 Working Group \"Technical Aspects\" Final Report (2001) including a risk analysis conducted specifically for therapeutic hyperbaric facilities. Many efforts have been spent to make the ECGP for HBO compatible with the new project of the European Norm prEN 14931 \"Pressure vessels for human occupancy (PVHO)--Multiplace pressure chamber system for hyperbaric therapy--Performance, safety requirements and testing\", which has been prepared at the same time by the CEN/BT/TF 127. Both groups (CEN/BT/TF 127 and COST B14 WG \"Safety\") cooperated extensively in the field of safety aspects of using hyperbaric chambers as medical devices, and both final versions of documents include many cross references. Being prepared by international Working Group \"Safety\" and after acceptation by all members of the COST B14 action, the ECGP for HBO represents a harmonised European view on safety in therapeutic hyperbaric facilities and can be used as a reference document for European countries for Guidelines, Regulations, and Standards in hyperbaric medicine.",
        "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) approval process provides medical device companies with the ability to market a device after the company establishes that the device to the marketed is \"substantially equivalent\" to one or more predicate devices. Companies that submit 510(k) notifications should be aware, however, that a 510(k) notification is a public document that may later reappear as evidence in patent litigation. Courts have considered 510(k) notifications to be relevant evidence in determining direct and contributory infringement, patent invalidity, and patent unenforceability due to inequitable conduct before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In one case, the court held that a substantial equivalence determination by FDA constituted evidence that can be \"construed as an admission of infringement.\" The court also has relied on a 510(k) notification to support a finding of personal liability for a corporate officer who signed the 510(k) notification to be evidence of willful and deliberate conduct, and have awarded treble damages and reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party. The potential for increased risk in patent litigation is important for practitioners in the medical device industry, because more than seventy-five percent of medical devices are approved for marketing through the 510(k) process. This article reviews a number of patent cases in which a court has admitted a 510(k) notification as relevant evidence, and proposes general strategies for avoiding these situations.",

        "No-React treatment is known to render tissues resistant to calcific degeneration and to reduce early inflammatory response. No-React bovine internal mammary artery (NR-IMA) is available for restricted use in Europe. In this first study, our aim was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the clinical performance and patency rates of this conduit.\nSeven patients received 8 grafts with NR-IMA. Approval from the Medical Devices Agency of the United Kingdom was obtained for use of this material. One patient needed salvage coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Graft patency was investigated with cardiac MRI. One patient was excluded from the MRI study because of the presence of intracerebral metal clips. The mean follow-up period was 2.5 years with a range of 1 to 4.5 years.\nThere was no mortality in this group. After treatment 6 patients were asymptomatic, and 1 patient had class II anginal symptoms. Four (57%) of the 7 NR-IMA grafts remained patent. The longest patency was 4.5 years in a patient who underwent salvage CABG. Other associated grafts in this cohort of patients were 5 left internal mammary arteries (all patent), 1 radial artery graft (patent), and 7 saphenous vein grafts (4 [57%] of 7 patent). There were no occluded NR-IMA grafts in a patient with patent vein grafts.\nWe concluded that at 2.5 year follow-up, NR-IMA had a patency rate of 57% (4 of 7 cases). This rate matched the vein graft patency rate in this cohort of patients. With the longest patency of 4.5 years, use of NR-IMA seems to hold promise for the future.",
        "Gastro-Mida(x) is a non-invasive diagnostic medical device which carries out an extracellular bioimpedance tomographic analysis of the colorectal region with a neural technique interpretation using artificial neural networks to diagnose colorectal diseases. The aim of this spontaneous study carried out in various centres in Italy was to train Gastro-Mida(x) to distinguish normal patients from those with colorectal diseases.\nPatients who were referred to the Endoscopy Units of the 20 centres involved in the study to undergo colonoscopy from September 2002 to December 2003 were included in the study. At least 1 day before colonoscopy, patients underwent Gastro-Mida(x). The training of the bioimpedance tomography in this study considered patients negative (normal) when the colorectal endoscopy was normal or revealed only the presence of haemorrhoids. Patients were considered positive in the presence of diverticula (diverticulosis or diverticulitis), polyps, cancer. For positive patients with more than one pathology, neoplastic or preneoplastic lesions were considered more important than the others and the final diagnosis was made in accordance with this rule.\nOverall, the 20 centres enrolled 947 patients (males/females: 477/470; average age+/-SD: 57.44+/-13.85 years). The specificity registered after training was 80% (95% CI: 76.5-83.1) and sensitivity was 83.89% (95% CI: 79.5-87.4). The sensitivity of bioimpedance tomography in the subgroup of patients with cancer (N=68) was 88.2% (95% CI: 78.4-93.9). As to polyps, sensitivity was calculated as a whole and according to size classification. The sensitivity of bioimpedance tomography in diagnosing patients with polyps was therefore 78.3% (95% CI: 71.9-83.4). However, sensitivity increased to 83.7% (95% CI: 74.1-90.2) and 83% (95% CI: 70.7-90.8) when the bioimpedance tomography's ability to identify patients with at least one polyp > or = 6 mm and > or = 10 mm in size was taken into consideration.\nGastro-Mida(x) has proven to be a simple, reliable and accurate instrument, once training is completed, in the most common colorectal diseases. The device can therefore be proposed for both diagnosis and screening of colorectal diseases.",
        "Tissue engineering concepts will enter the clinical arena in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery soon and at high speed, replacing many procedures currently in practice.

        "The transformation of the cardiothoracic specialty requires a complete mind-set and skill-set change such that the specialty repositions itself in this era of complex cardiac disease, increased competition, technology innovation, financial constraints, rationed access to technology and increased scrutiny on clinical outcomes. The future offers a variety of surgical treatment options for patients suffering from disease states that have traditionally not been treated by cardiothoracic surgeons such as ablation for atrial fibrillation and cell therapy for heart failure. In addition, patient expectations for prolonged and quality-improved years are higher as they educate themselves on options that are less invasive. Failure to build a new repertoire of skills will mean diminished access to patients because referrals will be made to those cardiothoracic surgeons who are seen as innovators. Time is of the essence, as market dynamics are taking their toll. Cardiothoracic surgery today is still one of the most profitable specialties within the hospital and therefore, hospitals should be willing to support and differentiate their heart programs through new technology adoption. But cardiothoracic surgeons need to be open to explore new methods for treating cardiac disease and to work with industry in proving the efficacy and patient benefits of new procedures. At a higher level, pan-European approaches to new technology adoption need to focus on increased governmental spending on healthcare and on reimbursement strategies that make this possible. The medical device industry continues to invest heavily in new techniques and technologies and should be viewed as a strategic partner by individual surgeons as well as by the surgical societies. As industry continues to focus on areas such as research, product development, market development, professional and resident education, reimbursement, and patient access issues, it is imperative for surgeons to work collaboratively with industry to drive change for the cardiothoracic specialty and to maximize the resources that each offers to the other. Though not always understood, a common unity of purpose does exist and constructive methods to dealing with change can be developed together. Frost & Sullivan predicts a medical device industry compound annual growth rate of 8% in the next 12 years. Achieving that same level of growth specifically across cardiothoracic surgery would be tremendous.",
        "A multidomain, synthetic peptide designated B2A2 synergizes the activity of BMP-2. B2A2 interacts with BMP receptor isoforms, potentiating the action of BMP-2 in activating alkaline phosphatase and triggering Smad and MAPK signaling. B2A2's design permits its delivery as a local surface coating as well as a soluble co-factor, thus broadening potential bioengineering applications.\nBMP-2 induces osteogenic differentiation and accelerates bone repair. Although BMP-2 inhibitors have been discovered, no BMP-2 mimetics or enhancers that function in the physiological range have yet been found. Here we report that a synthetic peptide designated B2A2, consisting of (1) a BMP receptor-targeting sequence, (2) a hydrophobic spacer, and (3) a heparin-binding sequence, is a positive modulator of recombinant BMP-2.\nCultures of mesenchymal cell lines C2C12 and C3H10T1/2 were given B2A2, recombinant BMP-2, or both. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was assayed by conversion of paranitrophenol phosphate (PNPP). Signaling through Smad and MAP kinase pathways was monitored by Western blot. Receptor binding was assessed by incubating immobilized B2A2 with soluble recombinant receptor-Fc chimeras and detecting bound receptor by anti-Fc antibody ELISA. Surface coating of medical device materials was done by first dip-coating with silyl-heparin, followed by B2A2.\nTreatment of cells with B2A2 alone marginally increased ALP activity. However, B2A2 plus BMP-2 resulted in 5- to 40-fold augmentation of ALP compared with BMP-2 alone in C3H10T1/2 or C2C12 cells, respectively. This synergistic enhancement was observed over a broad concentration range (4-1000 ng/ml BMP-2). B2A2 interacted directly with BMP receptor isoforms (preferentially to BMPR-Ib and ActivinR-II). In cells, B2A2 + BMP-2 led to a repression of MAP kinase and an increase of Smad activation, consistent with known activation pathways of BMP-2. B2A2 was ineffective when paired with other cytokine/growth factors (basic fibroblast growth factor [FGF-2], TGF-beta1, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]). Simultaneous co-administration was not strictly required. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that temporal separations up to 1 h were still effective. B2A2 was also effective when delivered in a polystyrene- or stainless steel-coated surface through a heparin platform (silyl-heparin) while BMP-2 was added exogenously in solution. These results suggest that B2A2 might promote aggregation of receptor subunits, enabling BMP-2 to activate signaling pathways at effectively lower concentrations. Synthetic multidomain constructs like B2A2 may be useful to accelerate bone repair/deposition through augmentation of endogenous levels of BMP-2 or through local BMP-2 contained in artificial or engineered matrices.",
        "Colonization of airways with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is known to be a risk factor for infection and adverse clinical outcome in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Whereas infections with PA have been linked to contaminated medical devices in hospitals, sources of colonization and infection with PA in households of patients with CF remain to be identified. Using a standardized sampling protocol, we prospectively examined the presence of PA in 102 households of patients with CF in Germany. PA was detected in 73 (71.6%) of 102 households. PA was detected most frequently in drains of showers (39.6%), drainpipes of hand-basins in kitchens (35.0%) and bathrooms (34.7%), and drainpipes of toilets (26.5%). Toilet seats and dish-clothes did not show PA in any household. The frequency and intensity of cleaning measures did not impact the detection rate of PA. Results of the present study for the first time determinate the rate of contamination with PA in households of patients with CF. Future studies will determine the risk of transmission of PA from households locations to patients with CF.",
        "The necessity for Integrated Care has been debated controversially and the influence of the legislator and the consequences for the medical device industry discussed sufficiently. In fact, the German health system has been suffering from a lot of problems like cost expansions, but only solutions and not discussions can bring a progress. EvoCare has established a new standard in tele-therapy in Germany. This has been possible because this system maps the clinical therapy process to tele-therapy (and not vice versa), it is extendable for virtually any medical field of application, and the user interface is kept so simple that people inexperienced with computers and even with motor deficits are able to use it. Accompanying the patients from the hospital to their homes, EvoCare allows for shorter hospital stays without loss in treatment quality and more intense training without increasing therapists' average work time per patient. The experiences that have already been made with the described system, especially in the area of neurological rehabilitation and orthopedic prevention, underline its advantages for all involved partners.",

        "Improvements in disease management and the aging of populations in Western countries are the main factors that have resulted in a disquieting rise in demand for expensive hospital beds. The patient-centred and family-friendly concept \"Hospital at Home\" has recently appeared on the global scene of health services, promising to offer a solution. This type of service has proved to be very welcome to patients and those they live with. However, Hospital at Home schemes reported in the literature are organized only to provide improved primary care services, usually to patients who are discharged from hospital a few days early and for the rest of their treatment. These services are mainly provided by nurses who perform one or fewer home visits a day and the medical contribution, if any, is limited to telephone consultations when necessary. Whenever something unusual happens the patient is readmitted. Some Hospital at Home settings, which are characterized as \"admission avoidance\", actually include only patients with conditions so stable that they might have stayed at home anyway, with some good primary care support. Yet Hospital at Home has much more to offer. Incorporated in the administrative structure of a hospital as real wards, manned with doctors, nurses and other health professionals on 24-hour duty in shifts and providing frequent--at least twice a day--regular home visits by doctors and nurses, Hospital at Home can reproduce real hospital conditions in the patients' homes. Portable medical devices enable the performance of a wide range of examinations at home, while information and communication technology neutralizes distances and makes collaboration between the virtual team and other contributors feasible and effective. Almost any patient whose condition neither requires prompt surgical operation nor meets the criteria for admission to an intensive care unit can be safely hospitalised at home, provided that he is attended by a properly organized, properly equipped and highly alert Hospital at Home service.",

        "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of nonthermal extremely high-frequency microwave radiations in a plant-based bioassay, represented by tobacco plants reacting to tobacco mosaic virus with a hypersensitive response leading to the appearance of necrotic lesions at the infection sites.\nThis study was performed blind and different experimental protocols on tobacco plants inoculated with tobacco mosaic virus were used. BIO-OBJECTS: Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. cultivar Samsun) carrying the resistance gene N against tobacco mosaic virus.\nTobacco plants or leaf disks were either directly or indirectly (water-mediated) irradiated using a medical device, designed for microwave resonance therapy. It produces nonthermal weak-intensity extremely high-frequency radiations, either modulated at extremely low frequency or in continuous flux of waves, coupled with a nonthermal red/near-infrared radiation.\nThe working variable was the number of hypersensitive lesions per leaf disk.\nBoth direct and indirect nonthermal microwave radiations led to significant effects on the hypersensitive response of tobacco plants: modulated radiations generally induced a resistance increase, whereas a continuous flux of waves induced a resistance decrease with direct treatments only.\nNonthermal microwave radiations are effective on the hypersensitive response of tobacco to tobacco mosaic virus and their low-frequency modulation seems to be more bioactive than the continuous-flux of waves, particularly in the indirect water-mediated treatments.",

        "In a fatal incident in 1984 much discussed in the literature, a patient received 16,000 rads instead of the intended 180 rads when undergoing radiation treatment. This incident likely could have been prevented by the use of risk analysis.\nRisk analysis techniques to identify use errors have received increasing attention in health care. Use errors are defined as a pattern of predictable human errors that can be attributable to inadequate or improper design. Among the most widely used of the risk analysis tools are Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and fault tree analysis (FTA). The Therac 25 Radiation Therapy System incidents involved a combination of technical failures (software and possibly hardware) combined with human behavior resulting in catastrophic radiation overdoses.\nFrom a manufacturer's perspective, FMEAs and FFAs are valuable methods to systematically evaluate a medical device design's potential for inducing use errors. When these risk analyses are done early in the development cycle, potential faults and their resulting hazards are identifiable and much easier to mitigate with error-reducing designs. These risk management methods are excellent complements to other important user-centered design best practices.",

        "After letters containing Bacillus anthracis spores entered the U.S. mail in 2001, a problem emerged regarding how to decontaminate the letters, packages, and personal items in offices that received these letters. The effects of three sterilization methods (i.e. ethylene oxide gas [EO], electron beam [e-beam] radiation, and gamma radiation) were evaluated for a variety of office supply and equipment, personal use items, and over-the-counter medical devices. No single sterilization method was suitable for all items that could be mailed or found in an office. Damage or discoloration was evident for some items by each sterilization method. There were changes in the color of certain items, such as some of the packaging material, some pacifiers, some of the fabrics, and the nylon stockings after e-beam and gamma radiation. Both e-beam and gamma radiation damaged all film samples. Following EO sterilization and normal aeration, there were a number of samples with high (above 250 microg/g) levels of EO and samples with detectable ethylene chlorohydrin levels. The data would suggest that certain items exposed to EO sterilization must be further aerated prior to use, or discarded. Generic descriptions of products (such as plastics) or grouping of items (such as condoms) were not sufficient to predict what is safe in terms of EO residual levels remaining on an item. Successful decontamination of a wide variety of items will require careful selection of different sterilization methods.",

        "Similarly to other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Hungary has witnessed massive diffusion of healthcare technology such as drugs and medical devices since 1990. While substantial new pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and procedures have been liberalized, there has been no proper evaluation or training in their use. Healthcare providers have come to find themselves as entrepreneurs in private practice, while patients are acquiring an increasing awareness as customers of healthcare,demanding services in return for their taxes and contributions. This has led to extremely irrational patterns of investment in technology, with most an obvious waste of resources, while leaving basic needs unmet. Both the National Health Insurance Fund and the Ministry of Finance believe that the current pharmaceutical and medical device bill is too high. However, introducing a more transparent and flexible pricing and reimbursement framework may enable a more efficient allocation of the limited resources to be achieved.",

        "Because of their biofilm-forming capacity, invasive Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, which cause the majority of nosocomial catheter-related bloodstream infections (BSIs), are thought to be selected at the time of catheter insertion from a population of less virulent commensal strains. This fact allows the prediction that invasive and contaminating strains can be differentiated via detection of virulence-associated genes. However, the hospital environment may pave the way for catheter-related infections by promoting a shift in the commensal bacterial population toward strains with enhanced virulence. The distribution of virulence-associated genes (icaADBC, aap, atlE, bhp, fbe, embp, mecA, IS256, and IS257), polysaccharide intercellular adhesin synthesis, and biofilm formation were investigated in S. epidermidis strains from independent episodes of catheter-related BSIs in individuals who have received bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The results were compared with those obtained for commensal S. epidermidis isolates from hospitalized patients after BMT and from healthy individuals, respectively. The clonal relationships of the strains were investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. icaADBC, mecA, and IS256 were significantly more prevalent in BSI isolates than in commensal isolates from healthy individuals. However, the prevalence of any of the genes in clonally independent, endogenous commensal strains from BMT patients did not differ from that in invasive BSI strains. icaADBC and methicillin resistance, factors important for the establishment of catheter-related infections, already ensure survival of the organisms in their physiological habitat in the hospital environment, resulting in a higher probability of contamination of indwelling medical devices with virulent S. epidermidis strains. The dynamics of S. epidermidis populations reveal that detection of icaADBC and mecA is not suitable for discriminating invasive from contaminating S. epidermidis strains.",
        "Phthalates are a family of multifunctional chemicals widely used in personal care and other consumer products. The ubiquitous use of phthalates results in human exposure through multiple sources and routes, including dietary ingestion, dermal absorption, inhalation, and parenteral exposure from medical devices containing phthalates. We explored the temporal variability over 3 months in urinary phthalate metabolite levels among 11 men who collected up to nine urine samples each during this time period. Eight phthalate metabolites were measured by solid-phase extraction-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the between- and within-subject variance apportionment, and the sensitivity and specificity of a single urine sample to classify a subject's 3-month average exposure. Five of the eight phthalates were frequently detected. Monoethyl phthalate (MEP) was detected in 100% of samples; monobutyl phthalate, monobenzyl phthalate, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), and monomethyl phthalate were detected in > 90% of samples. Although we found both substantial day-to-day and month-to-month variability in each individual's urinary phthalate metabolite levels, a single urine sample was moderately predictive of each subject's exposure over 3 months. The sensitivities ranged from 0.56 to 0.74. Both the degree of between- and within-subject variance and the predictive ability of a single urine sample differed among phthalate metabolites. In particular, a single urine sample was most predictive for MEP and least predictive for MEHP. These results suggest that the most efficient exposure assessment strategy for a particular study may depend on the phthalates of interest.",
        "To test the efficacy of gendine, a novel antiseptic, containing Gentian Violet and chlorhexidine, in coating different medical devices, including endotracheal tubes (ETT) and urinary catheters (UC).\nWe determined the antimicrobial efficacy and cytotoxicity of ETT and UC segments coated, through an instant dip method, with gendine. Using the modified Kirby-Bauer method, gendine-coated devices showed zones of inhibition of >/=15 mm against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida parapsilosis.\nGendine-coated endotracheal tubes (GND-ETT) soaked in bronchoalveolar fluid (BAL) and incubated at 37 degrees C maintained a zone of inhibition of >/=15 mm against MRSA and P. aeruginosa for at least 3 weeks. Similarly, gendine-coated urinary catheters (GND-UC), soaked in urine, maintained a zone of inhibition of >/=15 mm against E. coli for 8 weeks. Using the minimum essential media elution method in mouse fibroblast cells, GND-ETT and GND-UC were found to be non-cytotoxic. Gendine-coated UC significantly reduced the amount of viable MRSA, E. coli or C. parapsilosis organisms adhering to their surfaces when compared with silver/hydrogel-coated urinary catheters or control uncoated catheters (P < 0.01). Similarly GND-ETT significantly reduced the adherence of the same organisms as well as P. aeruginosa when compared with control (P </= 0.02).\nGND-ETT and GND-UC impregnated using an instantaneous dip method, were shown to have broad-spectrum activity, prolonged antimicrobial durability and high efficacy in inhibiting adherence of organisms commonly causing nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Furthermore, these coated devices were shown to be non-cytotoxic.",
        "Staphylococci are a major cause of infections associated with indwelling medical devices. Biofilm formation on these devices adds to the antibiotic resistance seen among clinical isolates. RNAIII-inhibiting peptide (RIP) is a heptapeptide that inhibits staphylococcal pathogenesis, including biofilm formation, by obstructing quorum sensing mechanisms. Bismuth ethanedithiol (BisEDT) also prevents biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations. RIP and BisEDT were combined to prevent infections in a rat graft model, using antibiotic sensitive and resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. BisEDT, RIP, or rifampin, or their combinations reduced the graft associated bacterial load over seven days. BisEDT-RIP was the best combination, reducing bacterial load to undetectable levels. BisEDT-RIP may prove useful for coating medical devices to prevent staphylococcal infections.",
        "Bacterial adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins plays a major role in infections of host tissue and medical devices. In some species of gram-positive cocci, this adhesion is mediated by specific molecules present on the bacterial cell surface. We have used optical tweezers to dynamically measure the adhesive force between an individual Staphylococcus aureus bacterium and a fibronectin-coated surface. A bacterium was optically trapped and brought in contact with a 10-microm diameter polystyrene microsphere coated with fibronectin. The force required to detach the cell from the microsphere was measured by tracking the displacement signals of the trapped cell on a quadrant photodiode throughout the detachment process for a series of S. aureus strains expressing fibronectin-binding proteins with various degrees of mutation. The single-bond rupture forces ranged between 15 and 26 pN depending on the extent of mutation. No binding was observed in the strain with the highest degree of mutation. These results confirm that multiple regions of the S. aureus fibronectin adhesin participate in the binding process and provide further insight into the role of these regions in the adhesive process.",
        "Acidic or basic polyurethanes were loaded with antibiotics to develop materials to prevent medical device-related infections. A correlation between polymer-antibiotic interactions and amount of drug absorbed by polymers and released over time was found. Since the employed antibiotics, i.e. amoxicillin, cefamandole nafate, rifampin and vancomycin, possessed at least an acidic group in their structural formula, the introduction of basic tertiary amines in the polyurethane side-chain resulted in an increased polymer ability to adsorb antibiotics. However, a stronger ionic interaction between this polymer and the antibiotics caused a release of lower amount of drug over time. Antibiotics released from polymers inhibited Staphylococcus epidermidis growth on agar. Antibiotic-loaded polyurethanes kept in water for increasing times were still able to show inhibition zones of bacterial growth. The antibacterial activity lasted up to 3 hours for amoxicillin, 24 hours for vancomycin, 8 days for cefamandole nafate and 8 months for rifampin.",
        "To describe patient characteristics, use of technology and mortality in children with meningitis admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).\nRetrospective cohort study.\nFifteen US PICUs.\nAll admissions with a diagnosis of meningitis between 1995 and 2000 in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Evaluations (PICUEs) database.\nOf 559 patients with meningitis, 58% were male. The median age was 19 months and the median length of PICU stay was 2 days. The crude PICU mortality rate was 7%. Three hundred thirty-four (60%) patients had bacterial meningitis. Non-survivors had significantly higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) III scores and also constituted a larger proportion of the patients with bacterial meningitis, coma and shock upon PICU admission. The use of invasive devices was higher among non-survivors, patients with bacterial meningitis or those who were in coma or shock upon PICU admission. There was significant variation in the use of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors by coma status and by institution. In multivariate analysis, patients had 1.26 higher odds of mortality for each unit increase in PRISM III score (odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval: 1.19-1.34), while adjusting for other variables.\nIn a large cohort of children admitted to the PICU with meningitis, severity of illness, particularly the presence of shock or coma, was significantly associated with both the higher use of invasive medical devices and higher mortality. There was significant variation in the use of ICP monitors among the various PICUs without statistical association with survival.",

        "Direct-current injuries have occurred to anesthetized patients connected to battery-operated medical devices. This study was designed to document the effects of direct current applied to two electrodes on a tissue surrogate (round steak) at room temperature. Direct current from a 9 V source was applied to a pair of stainless steel electrodes (1.6 cm diameter) spaced 4.3 cm center-to-center. Current flowed for 5 min increments at the first electrode site, 10 min at the second, 15 min at the third, etc. until at the last site, the current flowed for 30 min. In all, 63 measurements were made with the pair of electrodes, which were changed if they became corroded. Lesion appearance, lesion size, pH and resistance were measured. It was found that the pH under the negative electrode became strongly alkaline (pH > 12) and acidic (pH < 5.0) under the positive electrode. The lesion under the negative electrode was red with a dark purplish ring that identified the electrode perimeter. The lesion under the positive electrode was more uniform and gray in appearance. The largest increase in lesion diameter occurred in the first 5 min. In all cases the resistance decreased with the passage of time. At the start of each experiment, both electrodes were shiny. At the end of each experiment the electrodes were different in appearance. The negative electrode retained its original shiny appearance but the positive electrode was pitted and dull in appearance, reflecting the different chemical reactions at each site. The lesions under the negative electrodes were more severe, indicating that alkali is more damaging than the acid environment that was produced electrolytically.",

        "Treatment of infected orthopaedic hardware usually requires the removal of the appliance. When the device is removed and immediately replaced, persistent infection frequently complicates this exchange procedure. We modeled the exchange procedure in rats by passing a wire suture through a posterior spinous process and then contaminating the wound with Staphylococcus aureus. We then investigated whether a sequence of surfactant enriched irrigation solutions (Castile soap followed by benzalkonium chloride, sequential surfactant irrigation) had a greater capacity to eradicate Staphylococcus aureus from the experimental wound than did the standard wound irrigant, normal saline. When we left the wire in place through the 2-week course of the study, sequential surfactant irrigation showed only a modest advantage over normal saline (staphylococci recovered from 39% versus 58% of wound cultures respectively). Simple removal of the wire 24 hours after implantation and bacterial contamination prevented wound infection in most animals (with the wire removed, 38% of the animals remained infected versus 85% with the wire left in place), without regard to the irrigation solution. Alternatively, when we removed the wire after 24 hours, irrigated the wound, and then placed a fresh wire back into the wound, sequential surfactant irrigation showed a significant advantage over NS (54% of the animals irrigated with sequential surfactants remained infected versus 100% of the animals irrigated with normal saline). Our findings confirm the importance of a contaminated medical device for promoting foreign body infection; our findings also show that sequential surfactant irrigation has therapeutic value in a rat model of orthopaedic device infection; this irrigation protocol should be studied further as a potential agent for the treatment of infected orthopaedic wounds.",

        "The concept of biologically regenerating the intervertebral disc (IVD) using growth factor injection was first proposed in early 1990. Since that time, the technology to produce recombinant proteins, including growth factors, on an industrial scale has been developed. Currently, the effects of recombinant growth factors on IVD cells are less well known than those on articular cartilage chondrocytes.\nLiterature review.\nThe purpose of this review is to summarize the most recent findings of the effects of growth factors on the IVD and, further, to discuss trends in the biological repair of the degenerated intervertebral disc.\nA literature search was conducted using available databases, such as the National Library of Medicine, as well as data presented at scientific conferences held in the past 2 years, primarily in the United States.\nHerein, we report increasing evidence for the biological regeneration of the IVD. The effect of growth factors on the metabolism of IVD cells or tissues was studied using in vitro and in vivo approaches. In addition to using recombinant growth factor proteins, the gene transfer technique was also applied to study the effect of growth factors on the IVD. For in vivo studies, the availability of recombinant proteins and the use of gene transfer techniques accelerated progress in this field of research.\nThe results from these in vitro and in vivo studies clearly suggest the potential usefulness of recombinant growth factors as therapeutic drugs or as medical devices.",
        "Chest devices are encountered on a daily basis by almost all radiologists. A multitude of extrathoracic materials, from intravenous catheters to oxygen tubing and electrocardiographic leads, frequently overlie the chest, neck, and abdomen. Chest tubes, central venous catheters, endotracheal tubes, and feeding tubes are very common. Cardiac surgery involves the use of many sophisticated devices and procedures, ranging from valve replacement to repair of complex congenital anomalies. Coronary artery bypass surgery is no longer considered unusual, and in many large medical centers, ventricular assist devices and total artificial hearts are frequently encountered. Breast implants are visible at standard chest radiography, and many ancillary devices not intended for treatment of cardiac or thoracic diseases are visible on chest radiographs. New devices are constantly being introduced, but most of them are variations on a previous theme. Knowing the specific name of a device is not important. It is important to recognize the presence of a device and to have an understanding of its function, as well as to recognize the complications associated with its use.",
        "Implantable devices are major risk factors for hospital-acquired infection. Biomaterials coated with silver oxide or silver alloy have all been used in attempts to reduce infection, in most cases with controversial or disappointing clinical results. We have developed a completely new approach using supercritical carbon dioxide to impregnate silicone with nanoparticulate silver metal. This study aimed to evaluate the impregnated polymer for antimicrobial activity.\nAfter impregnation the nature of the impregnation was determined by transmission electron microscopy. Two series of polymer discs were then tested, one washed in deionized water and the other unwashed. In each series, half of the discs were coated with a plasma protein conditioning film. The serial plate transfer test was used as a screen for persisting activity. Bacterial adherence to the polymers and the rate of kill, and effect on planktonic bacteria were measured by chemiluminescence and viable counts. Release rates of silver ions from the polymers in the presence and absence of plasma was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).\nTests for antimicrobial activity under various conditions showed mixed results, explained by the modes and rates of release of silver ions. While washing removed much of the initial activity there was continued release of silver ions. Unexpectedly, this was not blocked by conditioning film.\nThe methodology allows for the first time silver impregnation (as opposed to coating) of medical polymers and promises to lead to an antimicrobial biomaterial whose activity is not restricted by increasing antibiotic resistance.",

        "Conventional ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) (Holter) monitoring involves 2 or 3 surface leads recorded with electrode positions and signal characteristics that are different from diagnostic quality 12-lead ECGs due to the limitations imposed by technology on the ambulatory recorders. The rapid pace of technological development for medical devices, particularly electrocardiography, has now enabled the recording of diagnostic quality 12-lead ECG waveforms for extended time periods. This capability allows Holter recording to become another source for diagnostic 12-lead ECG records on a par with other modalities such as resting ECG and exercise stress testing. Additionally, other diagnostic techniques such as S-T segment analysis and Q-T interval analysis that rely on diagnostic quality waveforms can now be applied. All of these enhancements to the traditional Holter modality have altered the regulatory perspective of these devices, since the enhancements may represent a new intended use for the device.",

        "Polystyrene Petri dishes, aminated by a plasma deposition process, were surface modified by the covalent linking of two different enzymatically modified hairy regions (HRs) from pectin containing, for example, rhamnogalacturonan-I and xylogalacturonan structural elements. The two polysaccharide preparations share the same structural elements of apple pectin, but the relative amounts and lengths of the neutral side chains present differ. Surface analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurement, and atomic force microscope (AFM) force-separation curves was used to characterize the effects on surface chemistry and interfacial forces of the surface modification process. Cell adhesion experiments using continuous L-929 fibroblasts and primary aortic smooth muscle cells were performed to evaluate the effect of the polysaccharide nature on cell adhesion. Results show that immobilization of the HR affects the interfacial field of forces and the cell behavior: \"equilibrium\" contact angles, obtained by a recently introduced vibrational approach, decrease after HR immobilization reaching a value close to 20 degrees . AFM force-separation curves show a more extended (or softer) interface in the case of the HR bearing longer side chains. Accordingly, depending on the HR preparation, cells shifted from spread morphology and adhesion behavior quantitatively comparable to that observed on conventional tissue culture polystyrene to rounded morphology and significantly lower adhesion. These data show that engineering of plant pectins can be a valuable tool to prepare novel and finely tuned polysaccharides having different chemico-physical and biological properties, to be used in the surface modification of medical devices and materials.",
        "In 2002, approximately 38,000 vertebroplasties and 16,000 kyphoplasties were performed in the United States. As the use of both modalities for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures has increased, so have questions regarding safety and efficacy. The authors addressed this by reviewing both the current literature and complications data reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health through the on-line database (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/maude.html) and through the Office of the Freedom of Information Act at the FDA. Although both procedures are largely safe, the FDA data highlight two main concerns: reactions to the use of acrylic (polymethylmethacrylate) bone cement, including hypotension and, in some cases, death, especially when multiple vertebral levels are treated in one setting; and a possible increased risk with kyphoplasty of pedicle fracture and cord compression.",

The defibrillator displayed an indication that it was in synchronized mode but provided no feedback to tell the user that it was not prepared to shock because of low QRS amplitude. USABILITY TESTING: A hands-on approach to discovering the difficulties and potential for error that people encounter when trying to use a product, usability testing can help to create medical devices and systems that are not only more \"user friendly\" and efficient-but safer.\nRecommendations are presented to enable health care leaders to apply human factors considerations in their product evaluation and purchasing decisions. Medical device manufacturers should involve human factors engineers in the design process from the outset and should perform usability testing. Health care organizations should expect an optimized and tested user interface in the medical devices they purchase.\nMany adverse events in medicine are the result of poor interface design rather than human error. The HFE concepts of usability and standardization are critical to patient safety.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for determining whether medical device manufacturers have provided reasonable assurance, based on valid scientific evidence, that new devices are safe and effective for their intended use before they are introduced into the U.S. market. Most existing color vision devices pose so little risk that their manufacturers are not required to submit a premarket notification [510(k)] to FDA prior to market. However, even low-risk devices may not be acceptable if they are marketed on the basis of misleading or excessive claims. Although most color vision devices are diagnostic, two types that are therapeutic rather than diagnostic are colored lenses intended to improve deficient color vision and colored lenses intended to improve reading performance. Both of these devices have presented special regulatory challenges to FDA because the intended uses and effectiveness claims initially proposed by the manufacturers were not supported by valid scientific evidence. In each instance, however, FDA worked with the manufacturer to restrict labeling and promotional claims in ways that were consistent with the available device performance data and that allowed for the legal marketing of the device.",

Implementation of NICE guidance varied by trust and by topic. Prescribing of some taxanes for cancer (P < 0.002) and orlistat for obesity (P < 0.001) significantly increased in line with guidance. Prescribing of drugs for Alzheimer's disease and prophylactic extraction of wisdom teeth showed trends consistent with, but not obviously a consequence of, the guidance. Prescribing practice often did not accord with the details of the guidance. No change was apparent in the use of hearing aids, hip prostheses, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, laparoscopic hernia repair, and laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery after NICE guidance had been issued.\nImplementation of NICE guidance has been variable. Guidance seems more likely to be adopted when there is strong professional support, a stable and convincing evidence base, and no increased or unfunded costs, in organisations that have established good systems for tracking guidance implementation and where the professionals involved are not isolated. Guidance needs to be clear and reflect the clinical context.",

Further analyses on some of the explanted IOLs included gross and light microscopic evaluation and RAMAN spectroscopy.\nLens exchange for late-onset IOL opacification was needed in seven eyes of six patients. IOL opacification became apparent between 15 and 25 months after uneventful phacoemulsification and lens implantation. Visual acuity varied from < 0.05 to 0.6 before explantation. In almost all cases postoperative visual acuity improved to the pre-opacification level. Light microscopic and spectroscopic analyses showed that the opacification was mainly located in the anterior portion of the IOL optic as a layer of irregular granular deposits composed of calcium phosphate.\nLate postoperative opacification of Hydroview IOLs may cause severe visual impairment, requiring explantation. Calcium phosphate is involved in the formation of these opacifications. Reporting on this type of complications is mandatory according to the Belgian and European directives for medical devices.",
        "The in vivo implantation of a mechanical device contributes to hemodynamic disturbances, which are responsible for damage to the membranes of red blood cells that in turn can lead to their rupture (hemolysis). It is important to ascertain at the design stage of such mechanical devices that they are innocuous to blood. Because there is no in vivo hemolysis index, we concentrated our efforts on the in vitro hemolysis index of the American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) standard. We present in this work a framework for minimizing medical device-induced hemolysis by the development of a numerical method for predicting hemolysis similar to that used in in vitro experiments. The method is based on a novel interpretation of the Giersiepen-Wurzinger blood damage correlation that replaces the computation of blood damage along the streamline by a volume integration of a damage function over the computational domain. We assess the behavior and accuracy of this methodology with 3D examples.",
        "Biofilms play an important role in many chronic bacterial infections. Production of an extracellular mixture of sugar polymers called exopolysaccharide is characteristic and critical for biofilm formation. However, there is limited information about the mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis and modification of exopolysaccharide components and how these processes influence bacterial pathogenesis. Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important human pathogen that frequently causes persistent infections by biofilm formation on indwelling medical devices. It produces a poly-N-acetylglucosamine molecule that emerges as an exopolysaccharide component of many bacterial pathogens. Using a novel method based on size exclusion chromatography-mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that the surface-attached protein IcaB is responsible for deacetylation of the poly-N-acetylglucosamine molecule. Most likely due to the loss of its cationic character, non-deacetylated poly-acetylglucosamine in an isogenic icaB mutant strain was devoid of the ability to attach to the bacterial cell surface. Importantly, deacetylation of the polymer was essential for key virulence mechanisms of S. epidermidis, namely biofilm formation, colonization, and resistance to neutrophil phagocytosis and human antibacterial peptides. Furthermore, persistence of the icaB mutant strain was significantly impaired in a murine model of device-related infection. This is the first study to describe a mechanism of exopolysaccharide modification that is indispensable for the development of biofilm-associated human disease. Notably, this general virulence mechanism is likely similar for other pathogenic bacteria and constitutes an excellent target for therapeutic maneuvers aimed at combating biofilm-associated infection.",
        "The risk of infections via dental sprays has been confirmed once again by the detection, inside dental unit waterlines, of bacterial and viral contaminations, both from water supplies and from the oral cavity of patients. Conventional means of prevention, flushing of the ducts before any dental treatment and anti-retraction devices intended to avoid contamination originating from the patient, evaluated in laboratory and clinical conditions, have been shown to be ineffective in controlling the risk. Tests carried out in vitro, with circuit models, and with the dental unit in service, have confirmed the efficacy of a method to disinfect the waterlines with a disinfecting solution based on TAED and Peroxidant, which in aqueous solution develop peracetic ions (Autosteril method). Zero bacterial count, zero viral charge and a complete biofilm demolition were achieved both in lab conditions and in service units. After hygienic treatment, the same disinfection method, once installed on old units that had been in service for years and without any hygienic device, allowed us to restore and to maintain the microbiological quality of the irrigant also in dental units of old design, and significantly reduced biofilm formation inside the waterlines. Therefore, on the basis of scientific findings, a microbiologic monitoring protocol is proposed in order to verify the hygienic conditions of units which are in service.",

A telephone survey is conducted on a sample of Paris University hospital staff (n = 327) using a structured questionnaire. Two-hundred sixteen persons completed the questionnaire. The response rate was lower among physicians, especially surgeons paid on an hourly basis. Rates of correct answers were different according to age, seniority, job, and department categories. Physicians and nurses correctly answered questions on theoretical knowledge more often than the other job categories. However, on questions dealing with actual practice conditions, correct answers depended more on age and seniority with a U-shaped distribution (minimum rates in intermediate categories of age and seniority).",
        "The goal of this research was to use a heuristic evaluation methodology to uncover design and interface deficiencies of infusion pumps that are currently in use in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Because these infusion systems cannot be readily replaced due to lease agreements and large-scale institutional purchasing procedures, we argue that it is essential to systematically identify the existing usability problems so that the possible causes of errors can be better understood, passed on to the end-users (e.g., critical care nurses), and used to make policy recommendations.\nFour raters conducted the heuristic evaluation of the three-channel infusion pump interface. Three raters had a cognitive science background as well as experience with the heuristic evaluation methodology. The fourth rater was a veteran critical care nurse who had extensive experience operating the pumps. The usability experts and the domain expert independently evaluated the user interface and physical design of the infusion pump and generated a list of heuristic violations based upon a set of 14 heuristics developed in previous research. The lists were compiled and then rated on the severity of the violation.\nFrom 14 usability heuristics considered in this evaluation of the Infusion Pump, there were 231 violations. Two heuristics, \"Consistency\" and \"Language\", were found to have the most violations. The one with fewest violations was \"Document\". While some heuristic evaluation categories had more violations than others, the most severe ones were not confined to one type. The Primary interface location (e.g., where loading the pump, changing doses, and confirming drug settings takes place) had the most occurrences of heuristic violations.\nWe believe that the Heuristic Evaluation methodology provides a simple and cost-effective approach to discovering medical device deficiencies that affect a patient's general well being. While this methodology provides information for the infusion pump designs of the future, it also identifies important insights concerning equipment that is currently in use in critical care environments.",
        "Non-diphtheria corynebacteria species cause disease in risk populations such as immunocompromised patients and patients with indwelling medical devices. Despite reports of exit-site infection and peritonitis caused by non-diphtheria corynebacteria, these organisms are frequently dismissed as contaminants. During a 10-year observation period, we prospectively identified 8 cases of exit-site/tunnel infections caused by 2 different species of corynebacteria (Corynebacterium striatum in 5 and C. jeikeium in 3 cases). Four patients experienced a second episode of exit-site infection 3 months (2 cases), 25 months, and 40 months, respectively, after termination of an oral cephalosporin therapy of 4 to 6 weeks' duration. Non-diphtheria corynebacteria accounted for 9% of all exit-site infections during the study period. All catheter-related infections healed; no catheter had to be removed. The diagnosis of catheter-related non-diphtheria corynebacteria infection may be suspected when Gram stain shows gram-positive rods and with colony morphology and commercial biochemical identification systems. Susceptibility of non-diphtheria corynebacteria to antibiotics may vary, especially in C. jeikeium. Virtually all Corynebacterium species are sensitive to vancomycin. Empirical antibiotic therapy with vancomycin should be initiated while antibiotic susceptibility testing is being carried out. Oral cephalosporin may be an alternative treatment regimen for exit-site infections if sensitive. This study highlights the importance of non-diphtheria corynebacteria as emerging nosocomial pathogens in the population of end-stage renal disease patients on on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.",
        "Bacteria have traditionally been regarded as individual organisms growing in homogeneous planktonic populations. However, bacteria in natural environments usually form communities of surface-adherent organisms embedded in an extracellular matrix, called biofilms. Current antimicrobial strategies often fail to control bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth. Treatment failure is particularly frequent in association with intracorporeal or transcutaneous medical devices and compromised host immunity. The rising prevalence of these risk factors over the last decades has paralleled the increase in biofilm infections. This review discusses the shortcomings of current therapies against biofilms both in theory and with clinical examples. Biofilm characteristics are described with a focus on new diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",

        "The effects of two aldehyde (Cidex, Endosporine) and four peracetic acid (PAA) (Nu Cidex, Anioxyde 1000, Hydraseptic, Peralkan) disinfectants on an Escherichia coli biofilm model were studied. The biofilm was prepared in glass tubes, and evaluated indirectly using a colourimetric method. The ability of the disinfectants to fix or remove the biofilm from tubes was determined by their detergent activity (DA). The two aldehyde derivatives and two of the PAA (Nu Cidex, Anioxyde 1000) agents fixed the biofilm. However, the effects of Hydraseptic and Peralkan were equivalent to the control (sterile water). Regardless of their disinfectant activity, PAA agents display different DAs that could be used to select the weakest biofilm-fixing agents. Users should be concerned about the efficiency of the cleaning stage of medical devices, and when choosing a PAA product, non-fixing ability should be considered in addition to antimicrobial activity.",
        "Candida parapsilosis is an important cause of bloodstream infections in the health care setting. We investigated a large C. parapsilosis outbreak occurring in a community hospital and conducted a case-control study to determine the risk factors for infection. We identified 22 cases of bloodstream infection with C. parapsilosis: 15 confirmed and 7 possible. The factors associated with an increased risk of infection included hospitalization in the intensive care unit (adjusted odds ratio, 16.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 148.1) and receipt of total parenteral nutrition (adjusted odds ratio, 9.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 98.1). Samples for surveillance cultures were obtained from health care worker hands, central venous catheter insertion sites, and medical devices. Twenty-six percent of the health care workers surveyed demonstrated hand colonization with C. parapsilosis, and one hand isolate was highly related to all case-patient isolates by tests with the DNA probe Cp3-13. Outbreak strain isolates also demonstrated reduced susceptibilities to fluconazole and voriconazole. This largest known reported outbreak of C. parapsilosis bloodstream infections in adults resulted from an interplay of host, environment, and pathogen factors. Recommendations for control measures focused on improving hand hygiene compliance.",
        "A hospital took a second look at a device error with a syringe pump in which a dose of fentanyl was delivered in half the anticipated time. When the nursing staff could not reproduce the error, the pump was sent to biomedical engineering where \"no problem was found.\" The biomedical staff subsequently performed another analysis, which led to discovery of the possible cause of the problem.\nA human factors engineering (HFE) task force, in considering the fentanyl delivery issue, identified a need to educate nursing and engineering on such incidents and to consider the consequences of override features. The HFE task force then reviewed a tool kit for briefing clinical units on education of staff on clinical safety issues.\nEfforts to maximize device customization or simplification can have negative HFE consequences. The decision to allow for function overrides or nontraditional equipment use must be weighed against the potential compromises in patient safety.\nThe problems that arise from the interface between humans and devices are not limited to intravenous pumps or even medical devices. Awareness of the potential for HFE design flaws can be critical in reducing harm in health care.",
        "The effect of cross-linking of a hydroxyapatite/collagen (HA/Col) nanocomposite, in which HA nanocrystals and collagen fibers are aligned like natural bone by a self-organization mechanism between HA and collagen in vitro, on mechanical properties was examined. The influence of degree of cross-linking, as well as rhBMP-2 preadsorption to the composite on the substitution pattern and rate with bone, was examined. In Experiment 1, anterior fusion was carried out at the C3-C4 vertebrae on 10 dogs and they were implanted as follows: without cross-linking and without adsorbed rhBMP-2 (three dogs), with cross-linking and without adsorbed rhBMP-2 (three dogs), without cross-linking and with adsorbed rhBMP-2 (two dogs), and with cross-linking and adsorbed rhBMP-2 (two dogs). Implants were removed from each dog for histology determinations after 12, 16, and 24 weeks in the non-rhBMP-treated groups, and after 16 and 24 weeks in the rhBMP-treated groups. In Experiment 2, the HA/Col composites with cross-linking and both with and without rhBMP-2 pretreatment were implanted into a bone defect of 20 mm made in the central part of tibiae in dogs (N = 3 in each group). As a control, bone defects of 20 mm remained without implantation (N = 3). The dogs were allowed to walk using an Ilizarov extra skeletal fixator. The implants were removed after 12, 16, and 24 weeks from one dog in each group. The cross-linking of the HA/Col composite was effective in controlling both the mechanical strength and bioresorbability. A \"self-organization process\" on the HA/Col implant surface resulted in the formation of bone remodeling units in and around the implant. Radiographic and histological findings suggest that a combined treatment of cross-linking of the HA/Col composite with preadsorption of rhBMP-2 molecules may be a very suitable replacement of existing ceramic systems in the anterior fusion of the cervical spine, as well as inlay grafting of bone defects in weight-bearing sites.",
        "Although dental amalgam has been a restorative material for more than 150 years, government regulation of its use and disposal came much later with the creation of new federal laws and agencies. None of the federal laws regulating dental amalgam today were written specifically to regulate amalgam. Instead, these new laws and agencies were created to address broad public safety concerns, where little or no regulation existed before, in the areas of medical devices and drugs and environmental pollution. It is the interpretation and implementation of environmental laws that recently have had the greatest impact on dental practices.",

        "\"No one has advanced a just and logical reason why reward for service to the public should be extended to the inventor of a mechanical toy and denied to the genius whose patience, foresight, and effort have given a valuable new [discovery] to mankind\" (Katopis CJ. Patents v patents: policy implications of recent patent legislation. St John's Law Review 1997;71:329). The law around the world permits the granting of patents for drugs, medical devices, and cosmetic treatment of the human body. At the same time, patentability for a method of treatment of the same body is denied in some countries on various public policy grounds. Is there any logical justification for this distinction? Are methods of medical treatment not as vital to the health or even to the life of a patient as drugs or medical devices? Why is a cosmetic result patentable and a curative result not?",
        "The detachment of cells from bacterial biofilms is an important, yet poorly understood and largely unquantified phenomenon. Detached cell clumps from medical devices may form microemboli and lead to metastasis, especially if they are resistant to host defenses and antibiotics. In manufacturing plants detached clumps entering a process stream decrease product quality. Two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a wild type (PAO1) and a cell signaling mutant (JP1), were studied to (i) quantify and model detachment patterns and (ii) determine the influence of cell signaling on detachment. We collected effluent from a biofilm flowthrough reactor and determined the size distribution for cell detachment events by microscopic examination and image analysis. The two strains were similar in terms of both biofilm structure and detachment patterns. Most of the detachment events were single-cell events; however, multiple-cell detachment events contributed a large fraction of the total detached cells. The rates at which events containing multiple cells detached from the biofilm were estimated by fitting a statistical model to the size distribution data. For events consisting of at least 1,000 cells, the estimated rates were 4.5 events mm(-2) min(-1) for PAO1 and 4.3 events mm(-2) min(-1) for JP1. These rates may be significant when they are scaled up to the total area of a real biofilm-contaminated medical device surface and to the hours or days of patient exposure.",

        "In recent years, internet-based home telemonitoring systems that allow transmission of patient data to a central database and offer immediate access to the data by the care providers have become available. The adoption of Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) as a W3C standard has generated a lot of interest in the potential value of this language in health informatics. However the telemonitoring systems often work with only one or a few types of medical devices and thus are limited in the types of diseases they can monitor. This is because different medical devices produce different types of data and the existing telemonitoring systems are generally built around a proprietary data schema specific for the device used. In this paper, we describe a generic data schema for a telemonitoring system that is applicable to different types of medical devices and different diseases, and then we present an architecture for the exchange of clinical information as data, signals of telemonitoring and clinical reports in the XML standard, up-to-date information in each electronic patient record and integration in real time with the information collected during the telemonitoring activities in the XML schema, between all the structures involved in the health care process of the patient.",
        "Pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers and other biotechnology firms face increasing financial pressure as research and development expenses rapidly rise, mostly because of the need for longer, larger and more complex clinical trials. This environment creates valuable outsourcing opportunities for contract research organizations in traditional clinical research and an expanding variety of other services. But as contract research organizations (CROs) assume more responsibilities for conducting clinical trials, they may also be assuming liability risks for injuries to participants and for financial losses that may delay the regulatory approval process for a product. This article provides an overview of risk management strategy with an analysis of potential liabilities and establishes steps that may help minimize these risks.",
        "The advancement of technical power described by Moore's Law offers great potential for enabling more cost-effective medical devices and systems. However, progress has been slow. Many factors for this failure have been cited, including the anti-rational economic structure of healthcare and the complexity and long time scale of medical development. Christensen et al. suggest that \"disruptive technologies\" may circumvent some of these difficulties. \"Disruptive Technologies\" are defined as those that are established in one market, but then penetrate and overwhelm another market. These incursions are accelerated by economic factors, and capitalize on functionality, reliability, and advancements supported by the original market. Christensen has cited many examples from industrial and service businesses, but few examples can be found yet in healthcare. We argue that positive technology impacts in medicine occur most readily when innovators augment the skills of and collaborate with caregivers, rather than seeking to displace them. In the short term, a new approach may improve efficiency or quality. In the longer term, such approaches may obviate human tasks at lower-skill levels, and even permit task automation. One successful example has been the introduction of flexible monitoring for physiologic information. Systems for computer-aided diagnosis, which have failed to impact complex decision making, have succeeded in simpler specialty areas such as the interpretation of EKG's and mammograms, and may do the same with analysis of some pathology images. The next frontier may the operating room, and the adoption of such systemic technologies by caregivers in emergency medicine and general care may then have an even wider \"disruptive\" effect. Responding to time and cost pressures, and the desire to move care to the patient, other workers, such as radiologists, will drive the trend away from isolated, complex, large-scale devices, and toward integrated, modular, and simpler networked technologies. In summary, technological \"push\" will continue in the demanding cutting-edge application areas as always, but the \"disruption\" will occur through wider application of lower-cost technologies, pulled by the users. The capabilities described by Moore's Law will allow the advancements necessary to facilitate this dissemination of capability and its ultimate benefit, so long sought.",

The expectation is that patients who take responsibility for their own care will communicate more effectively with their health care team and be productive citizens in our society. Medical technology today and those products visible on the horizon, coupled in a telehealth network, provide promise to empower patients to participate fully in the management of their own health. Technology alone, however, will not integrate the elements required for an effective telehealth system.

        "Reuse of single-use devices (SUDs) was a common practice in many health care centers in the United States. In August 2000, the FDA presented a guidance document indicating their policy change that meant the FDA would regulate centers that reprocess SUDs.\nOur objective was to survey Michigan health care centers to determine the level of action that has been taken regarding this policy change and determine whether there has been a shift in the extent of reuse of SUDs.\nWe developed a telephone survey tool and contacted the infection control personnel in the 54 Michigan hospitals that had more than 200 beds.\nThe response rate to the telephone survey was 48 of 54 (89%). Prior to the FDA policy change, 46%, 17%, and 37% performed on-site, third-party, or no reprocessing of SUDs, respectively. Currently, 21%, 35%, and 44% performed on-site, third-party, or no SUD reuse, respectively. The major shift has been to utilization of third-party reprocessors as opposed to stopping reuse of SUDs. In the 27 centers that currently reprocess SUDs, the most common items included the following: compression sleeves, 13 of 27; pulse oximeters, 8 of 27; PTCA cardiovascular catheters, 7 of 27; and biopsy forceps, 5 of 27. There were 61% (11/18) that resterilized open but unused SUDs with an equal split between on-site versus third-party resterilization. There were 3 sites that stopped reprocessing SUDs completely as a result of the FDA policy change and 4 that previously did not reprocess SUDs that started using a third-party reprocessor.\nThe FDA policy change has impacted how SUD reprocessing is being performed in Michigan. Few centers (1/48) reprocessing any high or medium-risk SUDs on-site at the time of the survey. There has been little overall reduction in SUD reprocessing, but there has been a shift to use of third-party reprocessors.",
        "Although intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and other plasma therapeutics have had a relatively good safety record, improved methods for viral clearance are constantly being evaluated and incorporated into new manufacturing processes. Gamma irradiation has been used routinely to assure sterility of healthcare products and medical devices, but it has not been applied successfully as a viral inactivation method for biologics. We examine whether virucidal doses of gamma irradiation (50 kGy) can be delivered to a manufacturing intermediate form of IVIG, a fractionated plasma paste, with negligible effect on structural and functional integrity of purified IgG product. Immunoglobulins from paste were examined for radiation-induced damage by SDS-PAGE and ELISAs utilizing viral antigens specific for rubella, CMV and mumps. Fc domain integrity was assessed by immunoblotting, quantitatively comparing the binding of irradiated and non-irradiated materials to cell surface Fcgamma receptors, and by employing quantitative RT-PCR to study the kinetics of accumulation of mRNA for the immune modulatory cytokines IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-8, IFNgamma, and TNFalpha. The results demonstrate that Fab and Fc domains of IVIG remain essentially intact and functional after gamma irradiation to virucidal doses, suggesting that this method could be used to enhance the safety of IVIG products.",
        "Video capsule endoscopy represents a significant advance in the investigation of intestinal diseases. The performance of the procedure and indications are reviewed here in order to establish guidelines for its use, in accordance with current knowledge from the published literature. Capsule endoscopy is performed in patients who have fasted for 12 h, but who are allowed to drink 2 h after and to eat 4 h after ingesting the capsule. Software features highlighting suspected blood and allowing simultaneous viewing of two images reduce the time required to review the findings, as well as improving the diagnostic yield. Pacemakers and other electrical medical devices are no longer a contraindication to the procedure. Indications that have been validated include obscure digestive bleeding, intestinal lesions related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and familial polyposis. Capsule endoscopy frequently detects intestinal lesions in patients with Crohn's disease and could become the first-choice examination in patients with suspected Crohn's disease after conventional endoscopic investigations. Other indications currently under evaluation include celiac disease, pediatric indications, and examination of other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.",
        "The true public health burden of adverse events associated with medical devices is unknown. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to produce the first-ever national estimates of medical device-associated adverse events resulting in emergency department (ED) visits.\nFrom July 1999 through June 2000, reports of 10,395 medical device-associated adverse events were accumulated using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), which collects information on product-related injuries from the ED records of a national stratified probability sample of hospitals. The reports were used to estimate annual total number of medical device-associated adverse events as well as number of adverse events associated with specific devices, injury diagnoses, demographic characteristics, and patient disposition status.\nThe total estimated number of adverse events was 454,383 (95% confidence interval [CI]=371,156-537,610), involving a broad range of devices from 15 medical specialty groups. Unintentional traumatic events associated with a particular device appeared to be the most common mechanism of injury. The most prevalent types of injuries included contusions/abrasions, punctures, and lacerations; 13% of total estimated cases resulted in patient hospitalization. Adverse events occurred within healthcare facilities, and some were occupationally related, although they occurred at home more frequently than any other location (about 42%).\nThe magnitude of the total estimate, which is over four times greater than the annual number of adverse event reports received by medical device-regulating surveillance systems, emphasizes medical device-associated adverse events as an under-recognized public health problem. Planned collection of more detailed NEISS data will allow for appropriate public health interventions.",
        "Optical monitoring of various tissue physiological and biochemical parameters in real-time represents a significant new approach and a tool for better clinical diagnosis. The Tissue Spectroscope (TiSpec), developed and applied in experimental and clinical situations, is the first medical device that enables the real-time monitoring of three parameters representing the vitality of the tissue. Tissue vitality, which is correlated to the oxygen balance in the tissue, is defined as the ratio between O(2) supply and O(2) demand. The TiSpec enables the monitoring of microcirculatory blood flow (O(2) supply), mitochondrial NADH redox state (O(2) balance), and tissue reflectance, which correlates to blood volume. We describe in detail the theoretical basis for the monitoring of the three parameters and the technological aspects of the TiSpec. The comparison between the TiSpec and the existing single parameter monitoring instruments shows a statistically significant correlation as evaluated in vitro as well as in various in vivo animal models. The results presented originated in a pilot study performed in vivo in experimental animals. Further research is needed to apply this technology clinically. The clinical applications of the TiSpec include two situations where the knowledge of tissue vitality can improve clinical practice. The major application is the monitoring of \"nonvital\" organs of the body [i.e., the skin, gastrointestinal (G-I) tract, urethra] in emergency situations, such as in the operating rooms and intensive care units. Also, the monitoring of specific (vital) organs, such as the brain or the heart, during surgical procedure is of practical importance.",
        "PM2000 is a ferritic alloy obtained by powder metallurgy and is being investigated for potential applications as a biomaterial. This work aimed to assess the biological compatibility and to determine the influence of the processing route and further recrystallisation treatment on the magnetic behaviour. The magnetic behaviour has been analysed as a function of the hysteresis loop obtained by using an inductive method. The biocompatibility has been tested using human osteoblast-like cells seeded onto discs of PM2000. The ability of cells, on its surface, to attach, grow, and produce alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was determined. It is shown that PM2000 is a soft magnetic material irrespective of its material condition, its remanent magnetisation being very low (up to about 3% for the recrystallised swaged material). Fields close to 200 Oe are required to saturate the material. The saturation magnetisation is about 135 emu g(-1). In vitro tests indicate that cells are able to attach and grow onto its surface, and produce ALP, a specific marker of cells with bone-forming activity. In this respect, PM2000 holds promise as a suitable substrate for bone integration. These properties could make PM2000 a useful candidate for the preparation of medical devices where biocompatible and soft magnetic materials are sought. Applications for dental magnetic attachments could be envisaged.",

        "A medical device using riboflavin (RB) and light is being developed for the reduction of pathogens in platelet concentrates (MIRASOL pathogen reduction technology [PRT]). A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the quantification of RB and its main photoproduct, lumichrome (LC) in blood components has been developed and validated. In addition, the same method has been used to identify and quantify the presence of additional photoproducts-catabolites of RB. Levels of these agents before and after treatment as well as endogenous levels present in normal donor blood are reported using this analytical technique. The method allows for quantitative and qualitative analysis of RB and LC in blood components using HPLC-fluorescence detection, a Zorbax SB-CN (stable bond cyano) column and a methanol-water mobile phase. Quantitation and qualitative analysis of additional photoproducts of RB was also performed, but the method has not been validated for these other components. The method described has passed an 8 day validation and has been found to be adequate for its intended use. The range of the method for RB is 0.016-1.500 microM and for LC is 0.060-1.500 microM. The method detection limit for RB is 0.0006 microM and for LC is 0.012 microM. The acceptance criteria for repeatability were met; the relative standard deviation for RB was 0.64% and for LC was 0.76%. The acceptance criteria for bias were met with a 97% average recovery for RB and a 102% recovery for LC. Samples were centrifuged and diluted 1:50 with 0.9% saline before analysis. No protein precipitation or extraction was required. A mass balance of approximately 93.4-94.4% was achieved after exposure of products to UV light in the intended pathogen reduction treatment method. The method permitted the identification of photoproducts in blood that were both naturally occurring and produced after photolysis of blood samples treated with the PRT process. The identity of these photoproducts has been established using HPLC Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) and UV spectroscopic methods and has been correlated with known metabolites and catabolites of RB. HPLC with fluorescence detection using a reverse phase cyano-column allows for accurate separation, identification and quantification of both RB and LC in blood products without the need for solvent extraction or protein precipitation. Additional photoproducts could also be identified and quantified using this method. The presence of these agents in normal, untreated blood suggests that their presence in blood is ubiquitous.",
        "A novel prosthetic anal sphincter (PAS) has been developed that aims to occlude by flattening and angulating the bowel, reproducing the action of the puborectalis muscle. The safety of the PAS has been confirmed in biomechanical, in vitro and long-term animal survival studies. The Medical Devices Agency approved implantation in 12 patients.\nThe PAS was placed in the pelvis around the anorectal junction via a transabdominal approach in 12 patients with severe faecal incontinence. The device was activated 6 weeks after surgery. Fibreoptic examination of the mucosa below the device was undertaken at various intervals during review.\nAt a median follow-up of 59 (range 30-72) months nine of the 12 patients had a functioning PAS. There were no device-related infective complications after the initial operation but one patient developed pseudomembranous colitis and had the device removed. The PAS was effective in restoring continence in ten of 11 patients. Median (range) Cleveland Clinic continence scores improved from 16 (7-20) before to 3 (0-7) after surgery. In two patients the PAS was eventually removed owing to infection after revisional surgery. There was no clinical or histological evidence of gastrointestinal mucosal ischaemia.\nThe PAS was effective in restoring continence. There was no device-related infection after the initial operation, no device erosion and no clinical or histological evidence of gastrointestinal ischaemia.",
        "Complications have been reported as a consequence of tourniquet application. These include skin abrasions, blisters and, breaks. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the difference in clinical outcome using tourniquets with and without skin protection.\nA prospective randomized trial was performed on consecutive patients undergoing elective total knee replacement or knee arthroscopy. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: group 1, tourniquet without skin protection; group 2, tourniquet with Soffban skin protection (BSN Medical, Melbourne, Australia); and group 3, tourniquet with the Atlantech skin protection drape (Atlantech Medical Devices, Harrogate, UK). All patients had identical tourniquets, tourniquet pressure and skin sterilization method. At the conclusion of the case, the tourniquet was removed and the skin beneath the tourniquet was inspected and recorded into one of four categories: skin normal, skin abrasions, skin blisters and skin break.\nOne hundred and fifty consecutive eligible patients having a total knee replacement or arthroscopy were included in the present study. There were 82 total knee replacements and 68 knee arthroscopies There were 89 women and 61 men, the mean age was 51 years. No significant difference in patient demographics were found between the groups. The overall skin complication rate was lower in the tourniquet skin protected groups. Total skin complication rate in the non-skin tourniquet protected group was 12 patients out of 50. In the skin protected tourniquet groups, the number of skin complications was six out of 100. This was statistically significant P = 0.0034 (chi2-test).\nWe recommend that lower limb tourniquets should be used with skin protection beneath them.",
        "Infections with the leading nosocomial pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis are characterized by biofilm development on indwelling medical devices. We demonstrate that the quorum-sensing regulator agr affects the biofilm development of S. epidermidis in an unexpected fashion and is likely involved in promoting biofilm detachment. An isogenic agr mutant showed increased biofilm development and colonization in a rabbit model. In addition, nonfunctional agr occurred more frequently among strains isolated from infections of joint prostheses. Lack of functionality was based on mutations, including insertion of an IS256 element. Relative to other bacterial pathogens, quorum sensing in S. epidermidis thus has a different role during biofilm development and biofilm-associated infection. Our results indicate that disabling agr likely enhances the success of S. epidermidis during infection of indwelling medical devices. The permanent elimination of quorum-sensing regulation used by S. epidermidis represents a surprising and unusual means to adapt to a certain environment and type of infection.",

Clinical data on the day of inclusion and health resources used for rheumatoid arthritis over the previous 12 months (treatments, medical devices, physician visits, examinations, hospital admissions, and other health professional care) were recorded.\n1109 patients from 75 centres located throughout the country were included (846 female; mean disease duration, 10.6 years; mean age, 56.7 years). Active disease (swollen joint count > or =6, tender joint count > or =6, and two of: morning stiffness > or =45 min, C reactive protein > or =20 mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >28 mm/h) was observed in 146 patients (13.2%). Mean (SD) DAS(28) was 4.51 (1.55). Severe extra-articular manifestations were reported in 8.4%. ACR functional status was: class I, 19%; class II, 28%; class III, 31%; class IV, 22%. Comorbidity was observed in 44.9% of cases, particularly chronic pulmonary disease and coronary or peripheral vascular disease. Average AIMS2-SF dimension scores were between 4.56 and 6.18, and mean HAQ was 1.32 (0.77). Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were prescribed for 82.1% of the patients. During the previous four weeks, one DMARD was used in 62.5%, and two or more in 19.5%. Corticosteroids were prescribed in 72%.\nIn a rheumatoid arthritis population managed by hospital based rheumatologists, the disease was active in 13% and severe in more than one third of cases.",
        "Insufficient research on electromagnetic interference (EMI) with medical electronic equipment by the signals of wireless LAN has been done. Therefore, electromagnetic compatibility between medical electronic equipment and wireless LAN data communications was done (IEEE802.11a, b, and g). First, to determine if medical electronic equipment is affected by EMI caused by radio waves, we irradiated radio waves to ten types of medical electronic equipment in an electromagnetic anechoic chamber. EMI were observed on three pieces of equipment. Next, to determine if the electromagnetic field emitted by the medical devices might interfere with wireless LAN communication, we measured the electric field intensity. Data analysis showed that the electromagnetic wave emitted by microwave ovens was at almost the same center frequency of the communication channel specified by the IEEE802.11b for wireless LAN. Although the number of medical electronic equipment investigated in this study was small, hospital administrators should consider electromagnetic wave testing of all medical electronic equipment to be used in areas of common wireless LAN use when planning the installation of wireless LAN.",

This places significant responsibility for device selection on purchasers. This paper describes a retrospective analysis of decision making processes for infusion pump selection in three large hospitals and focuses on patient safety. Through a series of detailed interviews and a study of relevant documentation we characterized the nature of the decision-making, patterns of communication, and the roles of different participants. Findings suggest that success of the process is related to effective communication among participants with different expertise and adequate device usability assessment during the process.

        "A heparin-conjugated biodegradable polymer (PLA-heparin) by the direct coupling of heparin to polylactide (PLA) was synthesized and characterized. The surface exposed heparin content associated PLA-heparin was measured to be 0.067 microg/cm2. PLA-heparin coated surface has shown higher hydrophilicity rather than control PLA surface. The clotting time of PLA-heparin conjugate measured by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was significantly prolonged as compared to PLA. The bioactivity of bound heparin measured by APTT corresponds to 17.4% of free heparin. It has been also demonstrated that the conjugation of heparin suppresses the protein adsorption as well as the platelet adhesion. These results indicate that the unique property of bound heparin has an inhibiting influence on the coagulation, plasma protein adsorption, and subsequent platelet adhesion systems. This novel PLA-heparin conjugate could be applied as blood/tissue compatible biodegradable materials for implantable medical devices and tissue engineering.",
        "Although human factors engineering (HFE) is considered only in relationship to the design of medical devices or information systems technology, human factors issues arise in many aspects of work in health care organizations.\nIn one scenario, the resuscitation stretcher would not pass through the ED door closest to radiology. Many clinical work spaces were never formally designed for the work currently being performed in them; instead, they were adapted from existing space originally designed for a different use. In a second scenario, infusion pump malfunction was not apparent. The patient experienced a near miss secondary to poor design; users thought that the infusion pump had been turned off when it was not.\nHealth care can significantly benefit from the incorporation of HFE into the workplace. Introductory classes in medical and nursing schools on HFE will assist students in detecting HFE-related issues, making them less likely to suffer with them or overlook them once in clinical practice. More extensive training for patient safety and risk managers, that is, at a minimum, a certificate-level course from an HFE program, would enhance case and root cause analyses since these issues are rarely factored in.\nCollaboration with HFE experts and use of HFE principles may not make health care fool-proof, but it will make it less dependent on improvisation and ingenuity to protect patients from the system's vulnerabilities.",
        "All invasive procedures involve contact between a medical device or surgical instrument and a patient's sterile tissue or mucous membranes. A major risk of all such procedures is the introduction of pathogenic microbes that could lead to infection. Failure to properly disinfect or sterilize reusable medical equipment carries a risk associated with breach of the host barriers. The level of disinfection or sterilization is dependent on the intended use of the object: critical items (such as surgical instruments, which contact sterile tissue), semicritical items (such as endoscopes, which contact mucous membranes), and noncritical items (such as stethoscopes, which contact only intact skin) require sterilization, high-level disinfection, and low-level disinfection, respectively. Cleaning must always precede high-level disinfection and sterilization. Users must consider the advantages and disadvantages of specific methods when choosing a disinfection or sterilization process. Adherence to these recommendations should improve disinfection and sterilization practices in health care facilities, thereby reducing infections associated with contaminated patient-care items.",

        "Catheter-related infection remains a considerable problem in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). This study examined the adherence of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis to commercially available polyurethane and silicone peritoneal catheters in the presence and absence of a proteinaceous conditioning film. In addition, the effects of the conditioning film on the surface properties (advancing and receding contact angles, and surface rugosity) of these biomaterials were investigated. Bacterial adherence to polyurethane and silicone catheters, pre-treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or artificial spent peritoneal dialysate (ASD) for 1 h at 37 degrees C, was examined using a radiometric (2-3H-adenine) adherence assay. The advancing and receding contact angles and the surface rugosity of ASD- and PBS-treated biomaterials were examined using a dynamic contact angle analyser and an atomic force microscope, respectively. The bacterial isolates were selected to represent high and low cell surface hydrophobicity. The hydrophobic isolate exhibited both a significantly greater rate and a significantly greater extent of adherence than the hydrophilic isolate to both catheter materials, independent of pre-treatment. In general, pre-treatment of the catheter materials with ASD significantly decreased the subsequent adherence of both isolates owing to the deposition of a conditioning film on the surface of the biomaterial. ASD treatment also decreased both the advancing and receding contact angles and the surface rugosity of both catheter materials. This study highlights the influence of both bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity and biomaterial surface conditioning films on bacterial adherence to CAPD catheters. In addition, it is recommended that the effects of proteinaceous conditioning films on biomaterial surface properties should be considered when assessing materials for medical devices and products.",
        "For the in vitro study of cell-biomaterial surface interactions, the choice of cell type is crucial. In vivo data indicate that during the healing of the implant in the tissues, the pivotal cell types are the macrophages. These cells, upon interaction with any foreign material, might initiate a spectrum of responses, which could lead to acute and chronic inflammatory changes affecting the biocompatibility of the implant. Whether the mechanisms governing the type of evolving inflammatory reaction could be attributed to the macrophages functional differentiation mirrored by monocyte subsets during the polymer interaction, is poorly described. This in vitro study, therefore, attempted to investigate whether different biomaterials influence monocyte cellular activity, determined by the myeloperoxidase level and mitochondrial XTT cleavage, and phenotype dynamics characterized by the presence of CD14, RM 3/1 and 27E10 antigens. It is shown that different polymers exert differential potential to influence monocytes, both in their cellular activity and their phenotypic pattern. Thus, these findings demonstrating material-induced monocyte activation and monocyte phenotype modulation, are suggestive of the monocyte role as reporter cells in evaluating the biocompatibility of a synthetic medical device.",
        "A combination of shape memory characteristics, pseudoelasticity, and good damping properties make near-equiatomic nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) alloy a desirable candidate material for certain biomedical device applications. The alloy has moderately good wear resistance, however, further improvements in this regard would be beneficial from the perspective of reducing wear debris generation, improving biocompatibility, and preventing failure during service. Fretting wear tests of Ni-Ti in both austenitic and martensitic microstructural conditions were performed with the goal of simulating wear which medical devices such as stents may experience during surgical implantation or service. The tests were performed using a stainless steel stylus counter-wearing surface under dry conditions and also with artificial plasma containing 80 g/L albumen protein as lubricant. Additionally, the research explores the feasibility of surface modification by sequential ion implantation with argon and oxygen to enhance the wear characteristics of the Ni-Ti alloy. Each of these implantations was performed to a dose of 3 x 10(17) atom/cm(2) and an energy of 50 kV, using the plasma source ion implantation process. Improvements in wear resistance were observed for the austenitic samples implanted with argon and oxygen. Ion implantation with argon also reduced the surface Ni content with respect to Ti due to differential sputtering rates of the two elements, an effect that points toward improved biocompatibility.",
        "The determination of secreted levels of reactive oxygen species by implant-adherent cells in vivo is required for understanding of the role(s) of such reactive oxygen species for the tissue response around medical devices. A model with subcutaneous implants of c.p. titanium (Ti) or polystyrene (PS) (cell culture grade) inserted on the back of rats were used. Implants and associated cells were retrieved and assayed after 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Morphological analysis of exudate cells showed that polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) predominated after one day whereas macrophages were predominant after three days. The number of implant-adherent cells, as reflected by measurement of DNA, decreased with time. Ultrastructural observations showed that macrophages were predominant cells in contact with the implant surface. Measurement of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) secretion by implant-adherent cells during 40 min incubation ex vivo revealed a constitutive generation of 40-400 pmol H(2)O(2)/microg DNA, depending on implantation time. Stimulation with protein kinase C agonist phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) caused an increased H(2)O(2) generation by adherent cells at early (up to five days) but not later (7-28 days) time periods. No major differences between Ti and PS were observed. Taken together, these findings show that Ti and PS implant-adherent cells secrete H(2)O(2) under in vivo conditions. Further, a reduced capacity to mount an enhanced H(2)O(2) secretion upon stimulation was demonstrated at late time periods. The role of this mediator for biocompatibility remains to be established.",
        "The inflammatory response resulting from the implantation of a medical device may compromise its performance and efficiency leading, in certain cases, to the failure of the implant. Thus, the assessment of the behavior of inflammatory cells in vitro, constitutes a key feature in the evaluation of the adverse potential, or not, of new promising biomaterials. The objectives of this study were to determine whether starch-based polymers and composites activated human neutrophils. Blends of starch with ethylene-vinyl alcohol, with cellulose acetate and polycaprolactone, as well as composites based on all these materials filled with hydroxyapatite have been studied. A lysozyme assay was adapted to examine enzyme secretion from human neutrophils incubated with different starch-based materials. Changes in the free radical and degranulation activity of the neutrophil were also determined by measuring the luminescent response of Pholasin, a photoprotein that emits light after excitation by reactive oxygen species. The amount of lysozyme secreted by neutrophils incubated with the polymers did not exhibit significant differences between the tested materials. Results were in all cases similar to those obtained for the control (polypropylene) except for one of the starch blends (corn starch with polycaprolactone reinforced with 30% (w/w) of HA). The chemiluminescence experiments showed that polymers reduce the signal produced by activated neutrophils. Furthermore, for some polymers it was demonstrated that the phenomenon was due to an effect of the surface of the materials in cell adhesion or a simultaneous competition for the photoprotein in solution, which results in the decrease of the intensity of light emitted and detected.",
        "High molecular weight statistical copolymers of 1,3-trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and D,L-lactide (DLLA) were synthesized and characterized with the aim of assessing their potential in the development of degradable and flexible materials for application in the biomedical field. Under the applied polymerization conditions (130 degrees C, 3 days using stannous octoate as a catalyst) monomer conversion was high or almost complete, and high molecular weight polymers (M(n) above 170 000) were obtained. Significant improvement of the mechanical performance of these materials was observed in comparison to results previously reported for TMC and DLLA based copolymers of lower molecular weight. For the entire range of compositions the polymers are amorphous with a glass transition temperature ranging between -17 degrees C for poly(TMC) and 53 degrees C for poly(DLLA). The polymers vary from rubbers to stiff materials as the content of TMC decreases. All polymers are hydrophobic with very low equilibrium water absorption (<1.5 wt %). Thermal analyses and tensile tests were performed on polymer samples after water uptake. Due to a plasticizing effect of the water, the thermal properties, and consequently the mechanical performance, of the copolymers with higher content of DLLA were the most affected. After water absorption, the polymer mechanical behavior can change from glassy to rubbery, as observed for the copolymer with 80 mol % of DLLA. The obtained results suggest that these copolymers are promising candidates as biomaterials in the preparation of degradable medical devices and systems.",
        "The reported incidence of colonization of oropharyngeal medical devices with Candida spp. has increased in recent years, although few studies that have systematically examined the adherence of yeast cells to such biomaterials, the primary step in the process of colonization. This study, therefore, examined the effects of oropharyngeal atmospheric conditions (5% v/v carbon dioxide) and the presence of a salivary conditioning film on both the surface properties and adherence of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Candida tropicalis to PVC and silicone. Furthermore, the effects of the salivary conditioning film on the surface properties of these biomaterials are reported. Growth of the three Candida spp. in an atmosphere containing 5% v/v CO2 significantly increased their cell surface hydrophobicity and reduced the zeta potential of C. albicans and C. krusei yet increased the zeta potential of C. tropicalis (p<0.05). Furthermore, growth in 5% v/v CO2 decreased the adherence of C. tropicalis and C. albicans to both PVC and silicone, however, increased adherence of C. krusei (p<0.05). Pre-treatment of the microorganisms with pooled human saliva significantly decreased their cell surface hydrophobicity and increased their adherence to either biomaterial in comparison to yeast cells that had been pre-treated with PBS (p<0.05). Saliva treatment of the microorganisms had no consistent effect on microbial zeta potential. Interestingly, adherence of the three, saliva-treated Candida spp. to saliva-treated silicone and PVC was significantly lower than whenever the microorganisms and biomaterials had been treated with PBS (p<0.05). Treatment of silicone and PVC with saliva significantly altered the surface properties, notably reducing both the advancing and receding contact angles and, additionally, the microrugosity. These effects may contribute to the decreased adherence of saliva-treated microorganisms to these biomaterials. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the effects of physiological conditions within the oral cavity on the adherence of selected Candida spp. to biomaterials employed as oropharyngeal medical devices. In particular, this study has ominously shown that these materials act as substrates for yeast colonization, highlighting the need for advancements in biomaterial design. Furthermore, it is important that physiological conditions should be employed whenever biocompatibility of oropharyngeal biomaterials is under investigation.",
        "Recent developments in ocular implant technology require the in vitro evaluation of ocular compatibility in early stage development programs. This requires an understanding and appreciation of the biological interactions which occur in the ocular environment and their relevance with respect to the clinical complications associated with surgical implantation of devices. This paper describes the development of a series of clinically reflective in vitro assays for assessing the potential ocular compatibility of novel intraocular lens materials. Staphylococcus epidermidis attachment, fibrinogen adsorption, mouse embryo fibroblast 3T3 adhesion and proliferation, primary rabbit lens cell adhesion, human peripheral blood macrophage adhesion and granulocyte activation tests were employed to evaluate two widely used intraocular biomaterials poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and silicone, and a novel biomimetic phosphorylcholine-based coating (PC). The performance of these materials in the in vitro assays was compared to their ability to reduce postoperative inflammation in vivo in a rabbit model. The results demonstrated that the in vitro assays described here are predictive of in vivo ocular compatibility. These assays offer a more relevant means of assessing the ocular compatibility of biomaterials than those presently required by the authorities for regulatory approval of medical devices and implants.",
        "Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen, associated with medical-device related infections. Converting biomaterial surfaces into non-interactive surfaces requires a specific surface/interface design. One approach is to polish the surface, and a second is to coat the surface with an antimicrobial or protein resistant coating. This study showed that polishing a titanium surface or coating titanium with various treatments that decreased the surface's coefficient of friction, had no significant effect on minimising S. aureus adhesion to these surfaces under static conditions in comparison to standard medical grade titanium. The cell promoting coating, TAST, was found to increase the S. aureus density on its surface as expected. The only coating that significantly decreased the density of adhering S. aureus was the titanium surface coated with sodium hyaluronate. Thus such a coating could have potential use as a coating for ostoesynthesis, orthopaedic or dental implants.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule that amends its menstrual tampon labeling regulation to change the current term for tampons that absorb 6 grams (g) and under of fluid. A tampon with absorbency of 6 g or less is currently required to be labeled as \"junior\". FDA is changing the term \"junior\" to \"light\". The term \"junior\" implies that the tampon is only for younger or teenage women when, in fact, it may be appropriate for women of any age with light menstrual flow. FDA encourages women to use the lowest absorbency tampon appropriate for their flow to help minimize the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). At present, FDA requires standardized terms to be used for the labeling of a menstrual tampon to indicate its particular absorbency. This rule enables women to compare the absorbency of one brand and style of tampons with the absorbency of other brands and styles. FDA is issuing this final rule under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) to ensure that labeling of menstrual tampons is not misleading.",

        "To develop a vessel model with poly-vinyl alcohol hydrogel (PVA-H) with low surface friction for in vitro simulations of vascular pathologies.\nSimulations of variable vascular pathologies were based on human vessel casts reproduced in wax. Constructions of vascular models were then obtained by lost wax techniques. As materials, liquid silicon or PVA in organic solvents were used. After solidification, the wax was drained by heating. Comparison of PVA-H with silicone models included evaluation of surface characteristics (friction coefficient), of visibility (transparence and compatibility with medical imaging techniques), and of stiffness (pulsatility of vascular lumen). Both model types were integrated in a circulation circuit allowing for flow simulations and testing with endovascular medical devices.\nBoth model types were transparent and compatible with current medical imaging methods. PVA-H models exhibited much lower friction characteristics. PVA-H stiffness was closer to soft tissue when compared to silicone, allowing for pulsations during flow simulations.",
        "To compare the adequacy of cervical cytology sampling by a newly designed cervical cell sampler (the implement) with a commonly used, extended tip cervical scraper, namely the Jordan's spatula, by assessing the quality of cervical smears obtained.\nProspective randomised controlled trial, with the approval of the local Ethics Committee after informing the Medical Devices Agency in the UK.\nColposcopy Clinic in a District General NHS Trust Hospital in London.\nWomen attending the Colposcopy Clinic and having a good command of the English language (to avoid any misinterpretation of the information and enabling them to give informed consent) were invited to take part. Two hundred and twenty patients were recruited.\nThe women were randomised into two groups, each of them having two smears at the same time, half of them having their first smear with the Jordan's spatula and the other half having the first smear with the new implement.\nGood quality smears, assessed by evidence of effective sampling of the transformation zone, including immature metaplastic cells and also endocervical cells.\nFifty-four percent of smears taken by the new implement showed good quality smears, compared with 37% taken by Jordan's spatula, a statistically significant result with P value <0.001.\nA larger number of good quality smears, judged by evidence of sampling of transformation zone and presence of endocervical cells, were obtained with the new implement. The difference was statistically significant. This would enhance the ability to detect dyskaryosis and increase adequate smear rates, reducing unnecessary recall of patients for repeat smears.",
        "This manuscript explains the establishment and validation of metrological traceability of calibration for routine measurement procedures using common medical decision-making criteria. Metrological traceability is considered the basis for achieving comparability of measurement results in laboratory medicine. This concept is supported by European legislation, which demands that manufacturers provide assurance and demonstrate metrological traceability of in vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices. The guidance to comply with these legislative requirements is available in different CEN/ISO standards and is used as a basis of this manuscript. The goals and accomplishments in metrological traceability of SI- and non-SI analytes is considered. Specific problems, such as non-availability of primary reference materials and measurement procedures, lack of official endorsement, and non-commutability of certain reference materials are discussed. With respect to non-commutability, the use of split-sample measurements is advocated. Also, the expression of measurement uncertainty associated with the application of the metrological traceability chain is discussed. In addition, the need for post-market vigilance assessment of traceable performance is considered. Finally, laboratory medicine scientific and professional societies, diagnostics manufacturers, and clinicians are urged to share responsibilities for understanding the implications of metrological traceability of routine measurements.",

        "Use of stapling devices has become standard practice in many operations, and these devices have many applications, including ligation and division, resection, anastomosis, and fascial closure. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates surgical staplers as a medical device. Manufacturers and health-care providers report adverse events occurring during the use of surgical staplers to the FDA.\nTwo FDA adverse event databases, the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and the Alternative Summary Reporting database were searched for adverse events related to the use of surgical staplers. An FDA recall database, Oracle System Center Automated Retrieval, was searched for surgical stapler recalls and the reason for these recalls.\nWe characterized adverse events from 112 death, 2,180 injury, and 22,804 malfunction reports from FDA adverse event databases. We described 22 recalls for these products that are listed in an FDA database. A majority of these recalls were related to manufacturing or design problems.\nThe overall incidence of these events remains unknown; because these products are used so frequently, even uncommon adverse events may affect many patients. It is important for health-care providers to report adverse events to manufacturers so that they may work to improve the design of these devices and reduce use errors that contribute to the events.",

        "Attachment of a small, medical device to the human body for an extended period of time in an ambulatory setting requires the careful consideration of the physical form of the device and the physiological constraints limiting the time a device will stay on the skin. Factors such as the size of the device, the area of the device available for attachment to the skin, and the occlusive nature of the materials in the device are likely to affect adhesion. Here, plastic acrylic disks, 25 mm in diameter, containing a crisscross pattern of air-filled channels were tested on the forearm and abdomen using a moderately aggressive, unsupported, pressure-sensitive transfer adhesive in a pilot human clinical study. After vigorous exercise, droplets of moisture were observed in the channels followed by evaporation of the droplets over time. Disks without channels remained attached to the skin for about a day and a half, while disks containing 450 microm deep channels remained on the skin about three times longer. Little difference was found when the channel-to-channel spacing was increased from 1.3 to 1.6 mm, however 230 microm deep channels were less effective than 450 microm deep channels. Overall, the moisture vapor transport channels appear capable of reducing the moisture content of the outermost stratum corneum layer of the skin, increasing the strength of the stratum corneum, and increasing the time a device remains attached to the skin. The median trial-to-trial relative standard deviation of 45% observed in the pilot study can be used to design appropriately powered studies for the comparison of different device designs.",
        "This paper is an analysis of the economics of physical telerehabilitation, at home, in the clinic, and at work. This study was a precursor to generating a business case for manufacturing telerehabilitation systems. Pilot studies were performed and structured interviews conducted with providers, payers, patients, and employers. The data obtained were analyzed, in conjunction with published data, to understand the economics with respect to parameters such as lost opportunity costs at work, faster rehabilitation, and cost savings to patients, providers, payers, and employers. The results showed that telerehabilitation has a positive business case with respect to all the stakeholders. The ability to quantify and analyze data from patients remotely is convenient and economical to providers. Patients benefit by getting back to their normal activities faster, both at home as well as work. Telerehabilitation at work allows employees to be treated at work without having to take time to go to a clinic. Lost opportunity costs for employers are minimized when workers return to work faster and are treated onsite. The ability to measure progress quantitatively is beneficial for patients, providers, payers, and employers. Additionally, malingering can be detected and eradicated using telerehabilitation. Proper application of appropriate telerehabilitation technologies makes eminent economical sense. There is a strong business case for the application of telerehabilitation, onsite, in large corporations and therefore is profitable to medical device manufacturers.",

Skin testing of subjects and controls to lidocaine, latex, latex specific IgE, and GTA was negative. Skin testing to OPA resulted in immediate wheal and flare reactions in all 4 patients within 20 minutes and late reactions at 24 hours but negative reactions in controls. Subsequent to the testing, 3 of the patients returned for repeat cystoscopy in which GTA but not OPA was used to disinfect the cystoscopes and tolerated the procedure.\nOPA solution should be considered a cause of anaphylactic/allergic reactions following cystoscopy and possibly following instrumentation with other medical devices disinfected by this material.",
        "Bacterial pyrogens, capable of penetrating dialyzer membranes, are responsible for a systemic inflammatory reaction in hemodialysis patients. Dialyzer reuse, involving rinsing of the dialyzer with pyrogen-containing water, may exacerbate this situation. Studies of the mechanism of action of endotoxin suggest that it irreversibly damages the vascular endothelium. The novel endotoxin removal method described here, is based on affinity-binding of endotoxin by the adsorbent ClarEtox, a USP Class VI-certified resin that is the active component of the medical device DialGuard. Under standard hemodialysis operating conditions, challenge of DialGuard with Pseudomonas maltophilia supernatant-spiked dialysate, containing 35-193 EU/ml endotoxin, resulted in endotoxin levels below 0.05 EU/ml in the treated dialysate. DialGuard was able to decrease endotoxin concentrations in the dialysate from a range of 2.39-8.49 to <0.005 EU/ml. DialGuard supports high fluid velocities at low back pressures and can be sanitized using the heat sanitization cycle of hemodialysis machines. DialGuard offers a simple, user-friendly way to reduce the concentration of endotoxin in dialysate and water for dialysis at a low cost.",
        "Our purpose is to develop a system that converts computed tomography (CT) scans into an interactive three-dimensional (3-D) model of the thoracic cavity. This study will allow for the preoperative determination of optimal anatomical fit of intra-thoracically implanted medical equipment such as circulatory support devices. From the radiology data bank, we consecutively selected 34 cardiac and 42 noncardiac patients who had CT scans of the chest. Anatomical structures of the electronic CT scans were manually extracted using software. These structures included the thoracic cage, lungs, heart, and the great vessels. The information was converted into a 3-D surface mesh model, which was imported into a 3-D viewer to acquire direct anatomical measurements. The thoracic cage and intra-thoracic organs were measured for data analysis. A methodology was successfully developed to convert a patient's thoracic CT scans into interactive 3-D models, permitting the collection of key anatomical measurements to assess intra-thoracic device fit feasibility. Extensive measurements of the reconstructed thoracic cavity were recorded in a database format and analyzed. This study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a rapid preoperative screening method based on anatomical fit for the selection or rejection of patients who are candidates for an intra-thoracic mechanical device. This new method will allow for the virtual preoperative implantation of such devices within a patient's chest cavity.",
        "The adhesion and activation of monocytes and macrophages are thought to affect the foreign body response to implanted medical devices. However, these cells interact with devices indirectly, because of the prior adsorption of proteins. Therefore, we preadsorbed several \"model\" biomaterial surfaces with proteins and then measured foreign body giant cell (FBGC) formation, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) release, and procoagulant activity. The model surfaces were tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), untreated polystyrene (PS), and Primaria, whereas the proteins used were albumin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulin. FBGC formation, TNFalpha release, and procoagulant activity of monocytes were the highest for surfaces preadsorbed with IgG. FBGC formation was lower on surfaces with adsorbed fibrinogen and fibronectin than on uncoated surfaces. TNFalpha release and procoagulant activity of monocytes were similar on surface adsorbed with fibrinogen, fibronectin, or albumin. Monocyte activation was also affected by the surface chemistry of the substrates, because FBGC formation was the highest on PS and the lowest on TCPS. Monocyte procoagulant activity was the highest on Primaria. Adsorbed proteins and surface chemistry were found to have strong effects on FBGC formation, monocyte TNFalpha release, and procoagulant activity in vitro, providing support for the idea that these same variables could affect macrophage-mediated foreign body response to biomaterials in vivo.",

In view of the widespread tissue distribution of the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agent in human beings, new practicable decontamination procedures are urgently needed.\nWe adapted an in-vivo method using stainless steel wires contaminated with prions to the hamster-adapted scrapie strain 263K. A new in-vitro protocol of surface contamination compatible with subsequent biochemical detection of PrP(res) (protease-resistant form of the prion protein) from the treated surface was developed to explore the mechanisms of action of methods of decontamination under test. These models were used to investigate the effectiveness of innovative physical and chemical methods of prion inactivation.\nStandard chemical decontamination methods (NaOH 1N, NaOCl 20000 ppm) and autoclaving in water at 134 degrees C reduced infectivity by >5.6 log10 lethal doses; autoclaving without immersion was somewhat less effective (4-4.5 log reduction). Three milder treatments, including a phenolic disinfectant, an alkaline cleaner, and the combination of an enzymatic cleaner and vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VHP) were also effective. VHP alone, which can be compatible with electronic components, achieved an approximately 4.5 log reduction in infectivity (equivalent to autoclaving without water immersion).\nNew decontamination procedures are proposed to ensure the safety of medical and surgical instruments as well as surfaces that cannot withstand the currently recommended prion inactivation procedures.",

Clinical isolates studied included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Adherence was examined quantitatively per square centimeter, visualized by electron microscopy and related to slime production and hydrophobicity. Although all four strains adhered to VP shunts, there were marked differences, with S. epidermidis and S. aureus showing the highest adherence (67.0 x 10(3) and 15.2 x 10(3) bacteria/cm(2), respectively). Factors affecting adherence included incubation time and temperature, bacterial concentration, device material (lower for silicone than Teflon), slime production and hydrophobicity. These data might be helpful for devising novel strategies to reduce VP shunt infections.",

A 1-week sample of radiographs of injured upper extremities from the ED of University Medical Center (UMC), Tucson, Arizona, showed that 20% of the studies (19 of 95) contained at least one object on the injured upper extremity, but only one radiology report (1.1%) mentioned such an object. A review of 2489 upper extremity ED radiology reports from January to June 2002 showed only 47 reports (1.9%) that mentioned the presence of an overlying object.

However, in the largest studies, the prevalence of clinically relevant EMI was low. Most clinically relevant EMI occurred when mobile phones were used within 1 m of medical equipment.\nAlthough testing was not standardised between studies and equipment tested was not identical, it is of concern that at least 4% of devices tested in any study were susceptible to clinically relevant EMI.

In this article, the authors propose a methodologic framework for developing initial prior probability distributions in risk-stratified patient groups and a mechanism for incorporating accumulating procedure safety experience. In addition, they use this methodology to retrospectively analyze the clinical outcomes of 309 patients undergoing an infrequent interventional cardiology procedure, rotational atherectomy. These exploratory analyses demonstrate the feasibility of Bayesian updating applied to medical device safety evaluation and indicate that the methodology is capable of generating stable estimates of risk in a variety of patient risk groups.",
        "Spirotox is a short-term acute toxicity test with a large ciliated protozoan Spirostomum ambiguum. The test was created in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland, during the early 1990s. It was presented for the first time during the 6th International Symposium on Toxicity Assessment, in Berlin in 1993. S. ambiguum was very resistant to a wide range of environmental conditions, especially to pH and dissolved oxygen. Over the last 10 years the sensitivity of S. ambiguum to many classes of toxicants was evaluated. Spirotox was found to be very sensitive to heavy metals, fungicides, and pharmaceuticals used to cure diseases of the human nervous system. On the other hand, it was generally less sensitive than standard bioassays to simple organics. Spirotox was also used for analysis of cyanobacterial blooms. Though it was moderately sensitive to hepatotoxins, the test seems to be a good tool for evaluation of the entire toxicity of blooms. The last but not the least of the applications of the Spirotox test was evaluation of the toxicity of extracts from medical devices. Protozoa, which are the simplest eukaryotes, seem to be good screening bioassays for monitoring the technology of medical device production.",
        "Intravascular devices are widely used for vascular access but are associated with substantial risk of development of devices-related bloodstream infection (DR-BSI), which causes a considerable increase of morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospitalisation and growing medical costs. Since conventional treatment of DR-BSI fails in a significant number of cases, resulting in removal of the device, new approaches are needed to prevent bacterial colonization. In this paper, two antibiotics, rifampin and amoxicillin, have been adsorbed on polyurethanes exhibiting acidic or basic properties. The influence of the type of antibiotic-polymer interaction on the amount of adsorbed antibiotic and on the release kinetics was studied. It was seen that the antibiotic-polymer affinity increases both with the introduction in the polymer side-chain of functional groups and with the matrix hydrophilicity. The antimicrobial activity of the treated polymers, evaluated in vitro by the Kirby-Bauer test, depends on the amount of antibiotic adsorbed, on the strength of drug-matrix interaction and on the water swelling of the polymers. The inhibition zone of bacterial growth lasts only a few hours for the amoxi-coated polymers while remains at least for five months for the rifampin-coated ones. The presence of serum proteins decreases by about 30% the inhibition zone diameter of these latest matrices after two months.",
        "The risk of prion protein cross-infection has focussed attention on the potential hazards of protein contamination of re-usable medical devices. This study determined the frequency of protein contamination of ProSeal laryngeal mask airways (PLMA) after two cleaning procedures and tested the hypothesis that the combination of hand- and machine-washing removes protein contamination more effectively than hand-washing alone. After clinical use fifty-four PLMAs were randomly allocated to be washed by hand or by hand then machine. All PLMAs were then autoclaved at 134 degrees C for 4 minutes. After processing, each PLMA was immersed in a 1.2% solution of erythrosin B and examined for uptake of stain. The site (outer surface, bowl and edges of the cuff airway and drain tube, finger strap) and severity (nil/mild/moderate/severe) of staining was scored by a blinded observer. There were no differences in the site or severity of staining between the two cleaning procedures. Staining was detected on 89% of PLMAs that were hand-washed and 78% of PLMAs that were hand-, then machine-washed (P=0.27). When staining occurred, it was mild in 98%, moderate in 2% and was never severe. Staining was more frequent on the edge than at any other location (all comparisons: P < or = 0.01). The strap never had any staining. We conclude that residual contamination of PLMAs with protein deposits is common even when machine-washing is used to augment hand-washing before autoclaving. The infection risk associated with these deposits remains to be determined.",
        "Lipoprotein(a) is an important predictor of cardiovascular disease risk. The lack of internationally accepted standardization has impeded the broad application of this lipoprotein in laboratory medicine. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC), through its Working Group on Lipoprotein(a) and together with research institutions and several diagnostic companies, have succeeded in developing an international reference material that is intended for the transfer of a lipoprotein(a) concentration to manufacturers' master calibrators. IFCC SRM 2B has recently been accepted by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization as the 'First WHO/IFCC International Reference Reagent for Lipoprotein(a) for Immunoassay'. The assigned unitage of 0.1071 nanomoles of lipoprotein(a) per vial is traceable to the consensus reference method for lipoprotein(a) and will enable conformity by diagnostic companies to the European Union's Directive on In vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices for the metrological traceability of calibrator materials.",
        "Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones, is an important event in several biological processes, including wound healing. It plays a key role in determining the final functionality and integration of any implanted medical device. In addition, angiogenesis is a required event for organ development and has been accepted as a rate-limiting step in engineering tissue replacements. Besides these regenerative processes, uncontrolled angiogenesis is also involved in a number of pathologies, including tumor growth and metastases. Like angiogenesis, biomaterials also play a role in wound healing after medical device implantation and in tissue engineering. Interactions between the device biomaterials and host tissue will factor into the final device integration. Additionally, tissue-engineering strategies utilize biomaterials to a great extent because the paradigm of tissue engineering involves the use of cells, growth factors and scaffolding matrices in order to regenerate or replace tissue. Since almost all tissues are three-dimensional, the biomaterial scaffold plays an integral role in the paradigm. This review will emphasize the influence of biomaterials on angiogenesis as it applies to medical device implantation, tissue engineering and therapies for pathological angiogenesis.",
        "Medical diagnostics and clinical practice rely extensively on test and measurement instrumentation. It is therefore of paramount importance that test and measurement instrumentation provides reliable data of sufficient stability, within appropriate limits of accuracy. At the same time the intended purpose of a particular measuring instrument has to be taken into account. The essential problem of every measuring instrument is that it measures and indicates basically what appears at the input of the measuring instrument, which might be significantly different from the real condition of a measurand. Namely, it is assumed that a measurand is stable, repeatable, and relatively unsusceptible to environmental influences. All these requirements are difficult to assure in a biological system and especially difficult in medical practice. Technology could easily provide high-resolution measurements, but due to natural instability of a measurand and various influential parameters the measurement uncertainty is inevitable. Sometimes even gross measurement errors are introduced. To achieve the expected accuracy for intended purpose is therefore much more demanding than merely relying on manufacturers' specifications. This paper describes and analyses the mentioned dilemmas in the case of widely used infrared ear thermometers, with their benefits and limitations, as well as with regard to the European technical regulation in the field of medical devices.",
        "Iatrogenic damage from a therapeutic procedure in the neonatal period can have serious consequences. Although most side effects are minor, some may result in a major handicap or death of the infant. The development of new therapeutic strategies may result in not previously observed combinations of pathology. This review focuses on iatrogenic damage occurring in several organs and after several different therapeutic interventions. Special attention is given to pulmonary and gastrointestinal damage and iatrogenic damage as a result of systemic treatments. Valuable information and early detection of serious side effects is only possible when the pathologist is very well informed about the therapeutic interventions used, all medical devices are left in situ and a thorough autopsy is performed as completely as is permitted. However, the decline in autopsy rates could make it more difficult to determine the incidence of iatrogenic lesions.",
        "Except for bleeding complications, other serious adverse reactions of coumarin anticoagulants such as hepatotoxicity or skin necrosis are comparatively rare. Nonetheless, a small number of coumarin-induced (sub-) acute liver failures has been published.\nA retrospective analysis was performed of patients treated for liver disease between 1992 and 2002 at our department to evaluate the incidence, clinical findings and histopathology of coumarin-induced hepatotoxicity.\nThe retrospective analysis revealed eight cases of phenprocoumon-induced hepatotoxicity, including three cases of (sub-) acute liver failure which resulted in two orthotopic liver transplantations and one fatal outcome. Five patients with phenprocoumon-induced hepatitis recovered well after anticoagulation was switched to another coumarin derivate or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin. In all patients liver injury was predominantly of an hepatitic type. In the cases of (sub-) acute liver failure massive confluent liver cell necroses were histologically present, whereas among patients without liver failure mild portal to moderate active lobular hepatitis were observed. A retrospective analysis by BfArM (German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices) revealed 4390 cases of possible phenprocoumon-related adverse reactions since 1990, 2% of which had presented with hepatitis and 0.2% with liver failure.\nPhenprocoumon-induced liver disease is an uncommon complication, which can, however, cause (sub-) acute liver failure.",
        "On-table colonic lavage for preparing obstructed bowel prior to anastomosis or stoma formation is now routine in adults, but it is seldom used in paediatric practice. We describe a simple technique for intraoperative colonic lavage using inexpensive medical devices that are also readily available and disposable, a Replogle tube, a fine-bore sucker, and a 20-ml syringe. We have used this technique in infants with intestinal obstruction due to anorectal malformations, intestinal atresias, and post-NEC strictures, to good effect.",

        "During a widespread North American blackout in August 2003, the authors identified a cluster of patients presenting to their northern Manhattan emergency department (ED) with complaints related to medical device failure. The characteristics of this group with respect to presenting complaint, type of device failure, time spent in the ED, and disposition are described in an effort to better understand the resource needs of this population.\nThis was a retrospective chart review for all patients evaluated in an urban teaching ED during a 24-hour period spanning the duration of regional power failure. Charts for patients presenting with medical device failure as part of their triage complaint were abstracted.\nTwenty-three of 255 patients coming to the ED during the 24-hour period presented with medical device failure. Nineteen of the device failures were due to nonfunctioning oxygen conservers, three to ventilator failure, and two to airway suction device failure (one patient had two devices fail). Thirteen of these patients were admitted to the hospital and accounted for 22% of all admissions during the study interval. Discharged patients spent a mean of 15.1 hours (range: 3.8-24.4 hours) in the ED.\nPatients using electrical medical devices seek care in the ED when power failure occurs, and they require significant ED and hospital resources. Effective disaster planning should anticipate the needs of this population.",
        "The economic impact of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is substantial, but most studies provide cost estimates specific to a US population. We performed a cost-of-illness analysis of patients with RA for French society.\nA cross-sectional study among rheumatologists in 148 hospitals in France was conducted between November and December 2000. Data were collected on health resource consumption associated with RA (treatments, medical devices, physician visits, examinations, hospitalization, other health professional care) during the previous 12 months. Direct costs and social costs were evaluated for 1109 RA patients. The relation of costs to disease activity and severity was analyzed.\nThe annual direct cost of RA per patient was over euro4000. The costs due to hospitalizations represented around 60% of the costs. The major reason for hospitalization was acute care for RA in a rheumatic disease ward. Patients visited a physician an average of 13 times during the 12 months, 7.7 +/- 8.6 visits to an office-based physician and 5.1 +/- 4.4 visits to a hospital-based physician. Among them, 37% of patients were receiving at least one disability pension (16.7%) or sick-leave allowance (11.9%), with an estimated cost of euro7328 per patient. The mean annual budget per patient was euro2742. Medical and social costs increased in patients with severe disease (2 times), longer disease duration since diagnosis (more than double for patients with a history longer than 10 yrs vs patients with less than 2 yrs), active disease (1.4 times), and functional status (4 times more for American College of Rheumatology class IV than for class I).\nDirect costs represented 59% of the total costs for patients with active RA and 57% for patients with severe RA. Social costs represented 41% of the total costs on average.",
        "Metallic medical devices undergo degradation in vivo and the degradation products affect the chemistry and biological responses of cells and tissues in the immediate vicinity. The responses vary with the metal and cell type. In the current study, we examined the effects of several metals on a human monocytic cell line. Monocytes are important effector cells capable of responding rapidly to inflammatory and immune stimuli in a variety of ways, including production of inflammatory proteins, differential expression of surface adhesion molecules, enhanced phagocytic activity, and activation and differentiation to macrophages. Cells were exposed in the presence of (14)C-acetate to titanium, nickel, chromium, copper, or cobalt or vanadium at concentrations that were subinhibitory or inhibitory based on cellular mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity. Cell lipids were then extracted, separated by thin layer chromatography, and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Total cell protein also was measured. Titanium reduced cell protein content at concentrations that were noninhibitory to mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, whereas neither chromium nor cobalt affected protein amounts at dehydrogenase-inhibitory concentrations. In cells exposed to vanadium, the protein- and dehydrogenase-inhibitory concentrations were similar. The major effects on cell lipids appeared to occur in the neutral lipids, although chromium, cobalt, and titanium produced changes in some major phospholipids. These results suggest that metals differentially affect various metabolic pathways in THP-1 cells, perhaps related to their abilities to enter the cells or interact with the membrane. These alterations to the cells may affect the cells' abilities to respond to various stimuli that can damage the tissues.",
        "A firm bond between an implant and the surrounding soft tissue is important for the performance of many medical devices (e.g., stents, canyls, and dental implants). In this study, the performance of nonresorbable and reactive sol-gel-derived nano-porous titania (TiO(2)) coatings in a soft tissue environment was investigated. A direct attachment between the soft tissue and the sol-gel-derived titania coatings was found in vivo after 2 days of implantation, whereas the titanium control implants showed no evidence of soft tissue attachment. The coated implants were in immediate contact with the connective tissue, whereas the titanium controls formed a gap and a fibrous capsule on the implant-tissue interface. The good soft tissue attachment of titania coatings may result from their ability to initiate calcium phosphate nucleation and growth on their surfaces (although the formation of poorly crystalline bonelike apatite does not occur). Thus, the formation of a bonelike CaP layer is not crucial for their integration in soft tissue. The formation of bonelike apatite was hindered by the adsorption of proteins onto the initially formed amorphous calcium phosphate growth centers, thus preventing the dissolution/reprecipitation processes required for the formation of poorly crystalline bonelike apatite. These findings might open novel application areas for sol-gel-derived titania-based coatings.",

        "Puckered, dimply skin on the thighs, hips, and buttocks is known as cellulite. The cause of cellulite is not known, although there are a number of different hypotheses. In this study, we use magnetic resonance (MR) micro-imaging to study cellulite skin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported MR study of cellulite.\nHigh-resolution in vivo MR images of the postlateral thigh skin of two male groups and four female groups were obtained. Subjects were grouped according to their body mass index (BMI) and cellulite grade. A qualitative assessment of how MRI can be used to differentiate skin tissue at different levels of cellulite grading was performed.\nWe found that changes in skin architecture with cellulite can be visualized by in vivo MR micro-imaging. The skin fat layers beneath the dermis and down to the level of muscles are well visualized in the images. Also, the diffuse pattern of extrusion of underlying adipose tissue into dermis is clearly imaged, and was found to correlate with cellulite grading. We also show that other skin tissue parameters such as (a) the percentile of adipose vs. connective tissue in a given volume of hypodermis and (b) the percentile of hypodermic invaginations inside the dermis are correlated with cellulite grade.\nMR images can be interpreted to measure tissue parameters correlated with cellulite. Considering that we had only three subjects in each group, the achievements of this pilot study were highly satisfactory. We have shown that the in vivo micro-MR is a technique able to detect the effects of cellulite and gender. This study can be extended for further investigations of drugs and/or medical devices for cellulite treatment.",

        "Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis are major causes of infection related to biofilm formed on indwelling medical devices. Such infections are common causes of morbidity and mortality and, because of biofilm resistance to antibiotics, are difficult to treat. The RNAIII-inhibiting peptide (RIP) (YSPWTNF-NH2) inhibits the pathogenesis of staphylococci by disrupting bacterial cell-cell communication (known as \"quorum sensing\"). Using a vascular-graft rat model, we show that RIP, applied locally and systemically, can completely inhibit drug-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis biofilms. The present study provides the first direct demonstration that interfering with cell-cell communication by use of a quorum-sensing inhibitor can eliminate medical device-associated staphylococcal infections. We suggest that medical devices could be coated with RIP to prevent infections, including those by antibiotic-resistant staphylococcal strains.",
        "The gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most common cause of infections associated with catheters and other indwelling medical devices. S. epidermidis produces an extracellular slime that enables it to form adherent biofilms on plastic surfaces. We found that a biofilm-releasing enzyme produced by the gram-negative periodontal pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans rapidly and efficiently removed S. epidermidis biofilms from plastic surfaces. The enzyme worked by releasing extracellular slime from S. epidermidis cells. Precoating surfaces with the enzyme prevented S. epidermidis biofilm formation. Our findings demonstrate that biofilm-releasing enzymes can exhibit broad-spectrum activity and that these enzymes may be useful as antibiofilm agents.",
        "Staphylococcal bacteria are a prevalent cause of infections associated with foreign bodies and indwelling medical devices. Bacteria are capable of escaping antibiotic treatment through encapsulation into biofilms. RNA III-inhibiting peptide (RIP) is a heptapeptide that inhibits staphylococcal biofilm formation by obstructing quorum-sensing mechanisms. K(4)-S4(1-13)(a) is a 13-residue dermaseptin derivative (DD(13)) believed to kill bacteria via membrane disruption. We tested each of these peptides as well as a hybrid construct, DD(13)-RIP, for their ability to inhibit bacterial proliferation and suppress quorum sensing in vitro and for their efficacy in preventing staphylococcal infection in a rat graft infection model with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or S. epidermidis (MRSE). In vitro, proliferation assays demonstrated that RIP had no inhibitory effect, while DD(13)-RIP and DD(13) were equally effective, and that the chimeric peptide but not DD(13) was slightly more effective than RIP in inhibiting RNA III synthesis, a regulatory RNA molecule important for staphylococcal pathogenesis. In vivo, the three peptides reduced graft-associated bacterial load in a dose-dependent manner, but the hybrid peptide was most potent in totally preventing staphylococcal infections at the lowest dose. In addition, each of the peptides acted synergistically with antibiotics. The data indicate that RIP and DD(13) act in synergy by attacking bacteria simultaneously by two different mechanisms. Such a chimeric peptide may be useful for coating medical devices to prevent drug-resistant staphylococcal infections.",
        "In this study, it was demonstrated that the nanoindentation technique can be used to measure the elastic modulus and hardness of fine-wire cross-sections with diameters ranging from 100-200 microm. Using miniature optics and a specially developed micrometer positioning system, measurements were successfully performed on the wire cross-sections with an accuracy of 1 microm. Homogeneous wire cross-sections, such as MP35N (high-strength nickel-cobalt alloy), composite wires such as MP35N with a silver core (MP35N/Ag-core), and platinum-clad tantalum (Pt-clad Ta) were studied. From the nanoindentation measurements, the elastic modulus and hardness at different positions and depths were calculated. It was found that both elastic modulus and hardness reached a constant value below the hardened surface, which resulted from mechanical polishing. Material properties obtained from the measurements were compared with the literature values of bulk materials as well as available results on fine wires. The data from the wire cross-sections, especially the uniform material samples, showed that both the elastic modulus and hardness were significantly lower near the outer 10-15 microm of the wire as compared to the rest of the wire, which is due to surface weakening during manufacturing. In addition, both modulus and hardness showed a small but consistent \"sawtooth\" variation across the diameter of the wires, excluding the outer 10-15 microm, that is postulated to be induced by the distribution of residual stress.",
        "Several clinical and laboratory studies have demonstrated electromagnetic interaction between implantable medical devices like pacemakers and cell phones being operated in close proximity. Those devices are largely now immune to phone interaction or procedures have been established to limit their interaction. The use of cell phones near people with implanted neural stimulators has not been studied. This research was initiated to investigate electromagnetic interaction between current cell phone technology and specific models of Cyberonics neural stimulators. Out of 1080 test runs conducted for this study, no interactions were observed, and it was concluded that the phone technologies examined in this study did not adversely affect the Cyberonics NeuroStar (Model 102) NeuroCybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) System. This article provides details on the experimental procedure that was used, which can also be used to test other neural stimulators and test technologies, and the results obtained.",
        "There is considerable interest in developing medical devices that provide controlled delivery of biologically active agents, for example, to reduce the incidence of device-related infection. Silicone elastomers are one of the commonest biomaterials used in medical device production. However, they have a relatively high coefficient of friction and the resulting lack of lubricity can cause pain and tissue damage on device insertion and removal. Novel silicone cross-linking agents have recently been reported that produce inherently 'self-lubricating' silicone elastomers with very low coefficients of friction. In this study, the model antibacterial drug metronidazole has been incorporated into these self-lubricating silicone elastomers to produce a novel bioactive biomaterial. The in vitro release characteristics of the bioactive component were evaluated as a function of cross-linker composition and drug loading. Although conventional matrix-type release kinetics were observed for metronidazole from the silicone systems, it was also observed that increasing the concentration of the cross-linking agent responsible for the lubricious character (tetra(oleyloxy)silane) relative to that of the standard non-lubricious cross-linking agent (tetrapropoxysilane) produced an increase in the metronidazole flux rate by up to 65% for a specified drug loading. The results highlight the potential for developing lubricious silicone medical devices with enhanced drug release characteristics.",
        "There is a growing trend in hospitals throughout the world to incorporate mobile phones and other wireless technology to offer more efficient, cost effective, and higher quality healthcare. Misunderstanding of mobile phone systems, electromagnetic interference with medical devices, and available management solutions, however, has led to a wide range of inconsistent hospital policies. Recent reviews and commentaries on the subject have provided inconsistent and in some cases factually incorrect information that confuses the issue. At one extreme, unmanaged use of mobile phones in areas where life-critical medical devices are in operation can result in atypical situations that may place patients at risk. At the other extreme, overly-restrictive policies based upon speculation may deny benefits by acting as an obstacle to technology. Overly-restrictive policies may also not address growing and legitimate communication needs of patients and visitors in times of crisis. While it may not be feasible for hospitals to manage every mobile phone handset that is randomly brought into their facility without certain limits on use in areas where life-critical devices are commonly in operation, restrictions are not usually necessary throughout the entire facility. Restrictive policies are also better facilitated when easily accessible areas are designated where mobile phone use is encouraged. Controlled mobile phone systems for use by doctors and staff for hospital-specific communication, by contrast, can operate compatibly throughout the entire hospital facility with appropriate system design and management, even in sensitive areas, and such systems have already been deployed in a number of hospitals throughout the U.S.",
        "Nanotechnology provides multifunctional agents for in vivo use that increasingly blur the distinction between pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Realization of such therapeutic nanodevices requires multidisciplinary effort that is difficult for individual device developers to sustain, and identification of appropriate collaborations outside ones own field can itself be challenging. Further, as in vivo nanodevices become increasingly complex, their design will increasingly demand systems level thinking. System engineering tools such as object-oriented analysis, object-oriented design (OOA/D) and unified modeling language (UML) are applicable to nanodevices built from biological components, help logically manage the knowledge needed to design them, and help identify useful collaborative relationships for device designers. We demonstrate the utility of these systems engineering tools by reverse engineering an existing molecular device (the bacmid molecular cloning system) using them, and illustrate how object-oriented approaches identify fungible components (objects) in nanodevices in a way that facilitates design of families of related devices, rather than single inventions. We also explore the utility of object-oriented approaches for design of another class of therapeutic nanodevices, vaccines. While they are useful for design of current nanodevices, the power of systems design tools for biomedical nanotechnology will become increasingly apparent as the complexity and sophistication of in vivo nanosystems increases. The nested, hierarchical nature of object-oriented approaches allows treatment of devices as objects in higher-order structures, and so will facilitate concatenation of multiple devices into higher-order, higher-function nanosystems.",
        "Tsukamurella is a Gram-positive, variable rod-shaped, weakly acid-alcohol-fast, non motile, aerobic bacterium that belongs to the genus Rhodococcus. Tsukamurella has been reported as a cause of infections in humans with immunosuppression and indwelling foreign bodies. It has also been isolated in one patient with AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) as a saprophytic organism. Optimal management of infections secondary to this micro-organism is still uncertain due to the paucity of cases. The combination of a beta-lactam and an aminoglycoside, along with removal of medical devices, appear to be the treatment of choice. We report the case of an AIDS patient who presented with multiple lung cavitary lesions secondary to Tsukamurella. This is the first case reported of Tsukamurella as a pathogenic agent in an AIDS patient.

        "The incidence, risk factors and prognostic factors for candidal infection were determined in a prospective study of 280 infected patients. Thirty-one (11%) patients were infected with Candida spp., sub-divided into 18 (58%) with C. albicans, and 13 (42%) with non-albicans spp. (six C. glabrata, three C. parapsilosis, and one each of C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. guilliermondii and C. lusitaniae). Infection with Candida spp. was always associated with concurrent bacterial infection. By univariate logistic regression analysis, the degree of morbidity and the duration of mechanical ventilation were independent predictive factors for death, but infection with Candida spp., was not. Factors associated with Candida spp. infection were the degree of morbidity, intensive care unit length of stay, alterations of immune response, and the number of medical devices involved. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only independent risk factor for candidal infection was intensive care unit length of stay.",
        "The aim of this study was to evaluate the respective influence of the physicochemical interactions and the roughness involved in the first part of the biological substrate biocontamination.\nTherefore we compared the bioadhesion results obtained on the biological model substrate (Episkin) and on a commonly employed inert substrate (AISI 304 stainless steel), frequently used either in dermatology or in development of medical devices. The two studied strains presented different characteristics, both physicochemical and microbiological. Staphylococcus epidermidis, a relatively hydrophobic bacteria capable of exchanging interactions which are principally of the van der Waals type, adhered more to 304 steel than to the surface of reconstituted skin. As for S. aureus, an essentially basic, hydrophilic bacteria, was more adherent to Episkin (a bipolar, hydrophilic substrate) than to stainless steel (a unipolar, basic, hydrophilic substrate).\nIn the absence of electrostatic interactions, the adhesion of substrate-dependent bacteria to the surface of reconstituted skin was dependent upon the balance between gamma(LW), gamma(+) and gamma(-).\nConsequently, so as to restrict microbial adhesion and reduce adhesive binding between micro-organisms and the surface of the skin, it would be preferable to render this substrate hydrophobic and apolar through the use of appropriate surface treatment.",
        "Deposition of proteins on surfaces of medical devices has been recognized to putatively relate to the process of regulation of biomaterial-associated complications by attachment of fibrin clots, eukaryotic cells, and microbes. The molecules adsorb to a varying extent, depending not only on the physicochemical properties of the biomaterial, but also on the composition of the host fluid.\nAdsorption of proteins on catheters exposed both ex vivo and in vitro to dialysate of patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) was studied.\nPeritoneal dialysis effluent was collected from 5 patients with end-stage renal disease on continuous ambulatory PD. Tenckhoff catheters were obtained from 16 patients. Deposition of proteins on excised Tenckhoff catheters and tubing of different materials exposed to PD effluent in vitro was studied using 125iodine-labeled antibodies. Adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains was quantified on tubing exposed to PD effluent in vitro.\nThe presence of albumin, transferrin, immunoglobulin G, fibrinogen, fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, vitronectin, and thrombospondin was determined at various concentrations in PD effluent. All proteins analyzed were detected on PD catheters removed from patients. The extent of protein deposition on Tenckhoff catheters exposed to PD effluent, in vitro, rapidly reached a plateau and remained constant, as it did on polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene tubing. Adhesion of staphylococci was enhanced on Tenckhoff catheters exposed to PD effluent compared to unused PD solution.\nThe data identify surface exposed proteins that may serve as adhesion sites for microbes on peritoneal catheters indwelled in patients undergoing PD.",

        "Detergent-disinfecting agents (dD) are used daily for cleaning reused medical devices. We have devised a simple method to test dD detergent activity (DA) using an E. coli 54127 biofilm prepared in haemolysis glass tubes, which are cleaned with test dD, according to supplier's recommendations. Crystal violet 0.05% is used to colour the residual biofilm after dD (or tap water control) application. The biofilm quantification was made indirectly by measuring the absorbance of crystal violet at 585 nm. A measure of the detergent effectiveness called DA was calculated as the percentage reduction of colour from a tap water control. Fifteen products including enzymatic and non-enzymatic dDs were evaluated. Most enzymatic dDs gave a high DA, as did some non-enzymatic products. Thus, the view that enzymatic dDs are more effective than non-enzymatic dDs, put forward by some manufacturers, should be regarded with caution. The DA determination should help infection control teams choose, within the wide range of products available on the market, the most effective dD based on both its detergent and disinfecting activity.",
        "The ability to adhere to artificial surfaces and form biofilms is considered as a virulence factor of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one of the major causes of nocosomial infections, especially those related to implanted medical devices. Cell-wall teichoic acid is known to play an important role in biofilm formation of staphylococci. The structure of the cell wall and extracellular teichoic acids of S. epidermidis RP62A, a reference biofilm-positive strain, was studied by NMR spectroscopy and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Their structures were found to be a (1-->3)-linked poly(glycerol phosphate), substituted at the 2-position of glycerol residues with alpha-Glc, alpha-GlcNAc, D-Ala and alpha-Glc6Ala. D-Alanyl acylation of a sugar hydroxyl group seems to be a novel structural feature of teichoic acids from staphylococci.",
        "In seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical trial evaluation of an experimental medical device, a sponsor is required to submit experimental findings and support documentation to demonstrate device safety and efficacy that are in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP). The objective of this project was to develop an integrated data acquisition (DAQ) system and documentation strategy for monitoring and recording physiological data when testing medical devices in accordance with GLP guidelines mandated by the FDA. Data aquisition systems were developed as stand-alone instrumentation racks containing transducer amplifiers and signal processors, analog-to-digital converters for data storage, visual display and graphical user-interfaces, power conditioners, and test measurement devices. Engineering standard operating procedures (SOP) were developed to provide a written step-by-step process for calibrating, validating, and certifying each individual instrumentation unit and the integrated DAQ system. Engineering staff received GLP and SOP training and then completed the calibration, validation, and certification process for the individual instrumentation components and integrated DAQ system. Eight integrated DAQ systems have been successfully developed that were inspected by regulatory affairs consultants and determined to meet GLP guidelines. Two of these DAQ systems were used to support 40 of the pre-clinical animal studies evaluating the AbiCor artificial heart (ABIOMED, Danvers, MA). Based in part on these pre-clinical animal data, the AbioCor clinical trials began in July 2001. The process of developing integrated DAQ systems, SOP, and the validation and certification methods used to ensure GLP compliance are presented in this article.",
        "The Combitube is a ventilatory device consisting of a twin lumen tube with proximal and distal inflatable cuffs. The major benefit of the Combitube is that its design and function allow for ventilation through non-laryngoscope-assisted insertion into either the trachea, or esophagus. As with any invasive procedure, intubation using the Combitube carries certain risks and potential complications. The majority of complications are relatively minor; however, a rare and serious complication reported primarily in the anesthesiology literature is laceration of the esophagus. This reportedly rare injury is increasingly seen by medical examiners/coroners in the forensic setting. This paper presents a series of three cases of esophageal laceration and a single case of perforation of the hypopharynx associated with the use of the Combitube, while also exploring potential mechanisms of injury. In addition, this work demonstrates the vital role the medical examiner/coroner plays in identifying existing or potential problems with current or emerging medical devices.",
        "Staphylococcus epidermidis has emerged as a major nosocomial pathogen that is often associated with infections of indwelling medical devices. Microbial adhesion to implanted foreign materials is a prerequisite for establishing infection. We studied the time-dependent anti-adhesion effects of linezolid and vancomycin on three S. epidermidis clinical isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were identical for both agents for all three isolates (2 mg/l). Bacterial suspensions were added to polystyrene wells and treated with 0.5-4 times the MIC of linezolid or vancomycin at 0, 2, 4 or 6 h post-inoculation. Supra-inhibitory (2 and 4 x MIC) and inhibitory (MIC) concentrations of linezolid demonstrated potent anti-adhesion activity following 2 and 4 h deferred treatments. Even at sub-inhibitory concentrations (0.5 x MIC), suppression of staphylococcal adherence to polystyrene was still evident in most cultures. Linezolid at two and four times the MIC also exerted significant inhibitory effects in cultures that had been treated with a 6-h delay. Supra-inhibitory and inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin administered 2 h post-infection appeared equally effective as linezolid. However, sub-inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin showed minimal or no activity against bacterial adhesion. When vancomycin treatments were delayed by 4 h, only concentrations above the MIC prevented adherence. Linezolid has promising in vitro anti-adhesion activity that merits further studies to determine its role in the management of foreign-body infections.",
        "Patients' satisfaction with their medication or medical device has been of increasing interest over the past decade. This is reflective of the rise of the patient as consumer and the desire of pharmaceutical and device manufacturers to obtain feedback from the consumers about their products. Satisfaction with medication is more narrowly focused and should be distinguished from other aspects of satisfaction. The purpose of this article is to place the concept of patient satisfaction with medication in an appropriate theoretical context, to explore the challenges of performing this research, and to offer recommendations for the basis of satisfaction claims.\nWe reviewed the literature on satisfaction with medication or medical devices. We summarize and discuss the background, conceptual issues, and theoretical justification for studying satisfaction with medication. We offer examples of domains to be included and suggestions on how to develop a psychometrically sound satisfaction measure. We also address additional issues for consideration.\nMedication satisfaction is a type of patient-reported outcome, but is distinguished from other patient-reported outcomes-specifically health-related quality of life (HRQL) and self-reports of symptoms. The Theory of Reasoned Action provides one theoretical justification for the concept. The heuristic value of this theory leads to implications regarding the relation between satisfaction and adherence. In addition, the theory is consistent with the need to focus on the patient's beliefs and values concerning the impact of taking his/her medication. Although the beliefs will differ according to the specific drug-disease combination, the beliefs can often be categorized in several domains of satisfaction: symptom relief/efficacy, side effects, ease and convenience, impact on HRQL, general satisfaction, and additional domains specific to the given research question.\nPatient satisfaction instruments should be subjected to the same psychometrically rigorous standards and procedures as any other patient-reported outcome and should also be subject to the same regulatory standards as other patient-reported outcomes with respect to advertising and promotion.",

        "A medical device is being developed for the reduction of pathogens in PLT concentrates (PCs). The device uses broadband UV light and the compound riboflavin (vitamin B(2)).\nPathogens were added to single-donor PLTs. After treatment, the infectivity of each pathogen was measured using established biologic assays. In vitro PLT performance was evaluated after treatment and after 5 days of storage using a panel of 10 in-vitro cell quality assays.\nIn studies with viral pathogens, the Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) system provided average log reduction factors of 4.46 +/- 0.39 for intracellular HIV, 5.93 +/- 0.20 for cells associated HIV, and 5.19 +/- 0.50 for West Nile virus. For the nonenveloped porcine parvovirus, a reduction factor greater than 5.0 log was observed. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli bacteria were also tested with observed reduction factors to the limits of detection of 4.0 log or greater. PLT cell quality was adequately maintained after treatment and during storage. Although P-selectin expression, glucose consumption, and lactate production increased relative to controls, this was not beyond accepted levels. The pH of treated PCs also decreased slightly relative to control PLTs on Days 1 and 5.\nThe data indicate that the device successfully reduced the number of selected pathogens in PCs. Despite the fact that significant differences exist between treated and control in-vitro variables, it is speculated that the clinical effectiveness of both products will not be significantly different, based on comparison to historical data for products in routine clinical use today.",

        "Two related scenarios involving defibrillator devices reveal how inadvertent hazardous design can go unnoticed until engineers or patient safety personnel use human factors engineering (HFE) analysis. The first adverse event, in which the device was inadvertently turned off while being used to externally pace the patient's heart, resulted in an increased length of stay. The second scenario describes a similar close call and the useless acts of sanctioning the nurse and firing the engineer technician.\nFeedback to the end user about a device's status is an important design issue. It does not take much expertise to detect when there are problems with \"dialogue\" from the device to the person (that is, feedback). Many HFE issues have been cited in emergency care areas, and many medical devices--not just defibrillators--do not have readable and understandable feedback to the end user or the kind of automation that would make the wrong action harder to accomplish. All the interactions of multifunction devices with end users in a hectic, noisy, and dynamic environment need to be usability tested and validated. Nurses and engineering personnel can be trained to more easily see HFE design issues--and not dismiss them as individual failings or \"someone else's job.\" Medical device companies are starting to follow the guidelines and regulations that should help prevent adverse events.\nThe defibrillator's design problems had successfully masqueraded as \"expected\" glitches with hospital electrical utilities, personnel shortcomings, and personality problems. Adverse events related to seemingly simple devices can be prevented with HFE analysis.",

        "Biofilm consisting of bacteria enclosed in a matrix of exopolysaccharide (EPS) forms on many medical devices such as catheters and implants. Nosocomial infection is, thus, a newly recognized scenario of biofilm development. Biofilm removal by physical methods such as ultrasound and mechanical cleaning is reasonably effective but difficult to supervise in practice. Chemical methods are often ineffective because of biofilm resistance to biocides. In this study, we compared the efficiency of different detergents used in endoscope reprocessing.\nEscherichia coli biofilm was generated on Teflon and medical grade PVC tubing under low flow conditions. Sections of biofilm covered tubing were washed using test detergents and biofilm removal was assessed by counting remaining adherent bacteria after washing and by scanning electron microscopy to qualitatively assess the amount and nature of the remaining biofilm.\nControl tubing developed a multilayered biofilm consisting of >10(5) bacterial cells/cm(2). Only Matrix (Whiteley Medical, Sydney, Australia) produced >4 log reduction in viable bacterial numbers. Matrix and Epizyme Rapid (3M Australia, Pymble, Australia) were able to remove up to 75% and 60% of the biofilm, respectively.\nMany commonly used enzymatic cleaners fail to reduce the viable bacterial load or remove the bacterial EPS. Cleaners with high enzyme activity, Epizyme Rapid, removed more biofilm but failed to reduce bacterial numbers more than 2 logs. The only cleaner containing no enzymes, Matrix, significantly reduced bacterial viability and residual bacterial EPS.",
        "The most widely used sugar alcohols are: xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, lactitol and the products Lycasin and Palatinit. It is often claimed that xylitol is superior to the other sugar alcohols for caries control. This paper examines clinical studies on the caries-preventive and therapeutic effects of sugar alcohols with emphasis on sorbitol and xylitol. It is concluded that chewing sugar-free gum 3 or more times daily for prolonged periods of time may reduce caries incidence irrespective of the type of sugar alcohol used. It may be sufficient to do this only on school days. Sucking xylitol-containing candies or tablets may have a similar effect as chewing xylitol chewing gum. Clinical trials suggest greater caries reductions from chewing gums sweetened with xylitol than from gums sweetened with sorbitol. However, the superiority of xylitol was not confirmed in 2 out of 4 clinical trials comparing the caries-preventive effect of xylitol- with sorbitol-sweetened gums. The caries-preventive effects of polyol-containing gums and candies seem to be based on stimulation of the salivary flow, although an antimicrobial effect cannot be excluded. There is no evidence for a caries-therapeutic effect of xylitol. These conclusions are in line with those of recent reviews and with the conclusions of the Scientific Committee on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices of the EU Commission.",
        "Understanding the molecular basis of human disease has been the corner-stone of rationally designed molecular therapies. Medicine has a long history of treating patients with cell therapies (i.e., blood transfusions) and protein therapies (i.e., growth factors and cytokines). Gene therapies are the newest therapeutic strategy for treating human diseases. Where will gene therapy be in five years after the euphoria and frustrations of the last 14 years? This is a complex question, but the primary challenge for gene therapy will be to successfully deliver an efficacious dose of a therapeutic gene to the defective tissue. Will the delivery systems return to the early clinical trials of ex vivo gene therapy or will there still be a high demand for systemic therapy? Will systemic therapy continue to depend on viral vectors, or will non-viral and nano-particles become the new mode for gene delivery? The future success of gene therapy will be built on achievements in other fields, such as medical devices, cell therapy, protein therapy and nano-particle technology. This review describes the advances being made in the gene therapy field, as well as addressing the challenges of the near future for cancer gene therapy.",

        "Deep infection of megaprostheses remains a serious complication in orthopedic tumor surgery. Despite the use of systemic and local antibiotic prophylaxis the reported infection rate is between 5% and 35%. Silver-coated medical devices proved their effectiveness in reducing infections. The objective of this study was to examine in vivo the antimicrobial efficacy and possible side-effects of a silver-coated megaprosthesis. In a first study, 30 rabbits (15 titanium versus 15 silver-coated Mutars-endoprostheses) were infected with Staphylococcus aureus. In a second study, toxicological side effects were analyzed in 10 rabbits with a silver-coated megaprosthesis. The silver group showed significantly (p<0.05) lower infection rates (7% versus 47%) in comparison with the titanium group. Measurements of the C-reactive-protein, neutrophilic leukocytes, rectal temperature and body weight showed significant (p<0.05) lower signs of inflammation in the silver group. The analysis of the silver concentration in blood (median 1.883ppb) and in organs (0.798-86.002ppb) showed elevated silver concentrations without pathologic changes in laboratory parameters and without histological changes of organs. In conclusion, the new silver-coated Mutars-megaprosthesis resulted in reduced infection rates without toxicological side effects, suggesting that this prosthesis might be a promising device in tumor surgery exhibiting antimicrobial activity.",
        "The capacity of a routinely available alkaline cleaner for medical devices to inactivate the causative agent of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) was tested. The co-incubation of brain homogenates, prepared from terminally ill scrapie-infected hamsters, with the cleaner led to the denaturation of misfolded protein as the proteinase K-resistant prion protein was no longer detectable after such treatment. In addition, intra-cerebral inoculation of hamsters with the alkaline cleaner-treated and subsequently neutralized samples reduced the level of infectivity of the material below the limit of detection. This report shows the possibility that a routinely available alkaline cleaner could reduce the infectivity of TSE agents and so minimize the risk of iatrogenic transmission of TSEs by asymptomatic carriers. This study is intended to encourage further investigations in this field.",

Sponsor representatives and IOM determined the importance of maintaining a neutral setting for discussions regarding long-term and politically sensitive issues justified the need to revise and enhance past efforts. The new Roundtable is intended to be a mechanism by which a broad group of experts from the public* and private sectors can be convened to conduct a dialogue and exchange information related to the development of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Members have expertise in clinical medicine, pediatrics, clinical pharmacology, health policy, health insurance, industrial management, and product development; and they represent interests that address all facets of public policy issues. From time to time, the Roundtable requests that a workshop be conducted for the purpose of exploring a specific topic in detail and obtaining the views of additional experts.

One-hundred-and-four patients were analysed. Induction of anaesthesia was followed by ventilation of the lungs with a bag-valve device and an Oxylator (CPR Medical Devices Corp., Markham, Ontario, Canada) in manual and automatic modes. Each series was repeated twice by a fireman first responder using a hand-held mask to seal the airway, once under anaesthesia and then again under anaesthesia with muscle relaxation.\nPatients' mean age 49 +/- 17 yr; 47% male, 48-132 kg. Only 29% had optimal facial and airway physiognomy. Airway management was significantly poorer when the bag-valve device was used than with either Oxylator mode (P < 0.0001); 23% of cases were not manageable with the bag-valve device. Gastric insufflation was markedly less with the Oxylator (P < 0.02).\nThe use of an oxygen-driven device improves the ability of first responders to secure an airway and reduce gastric insufflation, even when distracted. Oxylators perform significantly better (P < 0.0001) than the bag-valve device.",

        "Implanted medical devices are of increasing importance in the practice of medicine and it is estimated that more than 3-million people in the United States have long-term implants like vascular grafts, pacemakers, catheters and joint replacements. Even though most biomedical polymers employed are relatively inert, unreactive, and non-toxic, most implant materials when contacted with blood invoke the activation of blood cells as well as the plasma proteolytic enzyme systems. In order to overcome aforementioned problems, attempts have been made to modify the surface chemistry of the blood-contacting biomaterials so that they become thromboresistant. One potential strategy to address the problem of the chaotic adsorption of proteins to medical devices and surfaces is to create a layer of albumin as a \"barrier protein cover\", as a thin layer of albumin has been reported to minimize adhesion and aggregation of platelets. By grafting peptides and synthetic ligands, that specifically bind human serum albumin, on an epoxide functionalized surface, we have generated surfaces that exhibit enhanced albumin binding over other serum proteins. We have characterized the surface using infra-red ellipsiometry and quantified protein adsorption via specific ELISA assays and gel electrophoresis.",
        "In order to regenerate critical-size bone defects, a variety of bone substitutes is used in addition to autogenous bone. The regenerative capacity of these bone substitutes is usually compared to the efficacy of autogenous bone known as the \"golden standard\". Different cytokines influence the regeneration process because of their morphogenic or mitogenic properties. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), a platelet concentrate, is characterised by having a positive effect on wound healing, reducing bone graft resorption and increasing the density of bone transplants. This experiment was commenced with a view to studying the osseous defect regeneration after placing various combinations of \"filler materials\" in experimentally created defects in the forehead of adult pigs. Regeneration by means of grafted autogenous bone (Group 1) or a bovine collagen based medical device (Group 4) alone and combined with PRP in two concentrations (Groups 2, 3, 5 and 6) was evaluated by means of microradiography and light microscopy after 2, 4 and 12 weeks. The microradiographic and light microscopic findings showed that autogenous bone in combination with PRP (Groups 2 and 3) had a significant accelerating effect on early bone regeneration (2 weeks). This effect was not evident when PRP was added to the bovine collagen (Groups 5 and 6). When using the collagen alone, significantly higher mineralisation values were achieved after 2 and 4 weeks than when using autogenous bone alone. After a 12-week observation period, the existing differences between the healing processes in the various groups were more or less levelled out. In summary, the results of the study indicate that clinically autogenous bone, as expected, is the ideal defect filler. Combining autogenous bone with PRP did not provide significantly better results. The findings in the groups treated with bovine collagen indicate that its local application mimics the effect of autogenous bone and amplifies bone regeneration when comparing with the control defect.",
        "Several strategies have been used to increase the biostability of medical-grade polyurethanes while maintaining biocompatibility and mechanical properties. One approach is to chemically modify or replace the susceptible soft segment. Currently, poly(carbonate urethanes) (PCUs) are being evaluated as a replacement of poly(ether urethanes) (PEUs) in medical devices because of the increased oxidative stability of the polycarbonate soft segment. Preliminary in vivo and in vitro studies have reported improved biostability of PCUs over PEUs. Although several studies have reported evidence of in vitro degradation of these new polyurethanes, there has been no evidence of significant in vivo degradation that validates a degradation mechanism. In this study, the effect of soft segment chemistry on the phase morphology, mechanical properties, and in vivo response of commercial-grade PEU and PCU elastomers was examined. Results from dynamic mechanical testing and infrared spectroscopy suggested that the phase separation was better in PCU as compared with PEU. In addition, the higher modulus and reduced ultimate elongation of PCU was attributed to the reduced flexibility of the polycarbonate soft segment. Following material characterization, the in vivo biostability and biocompatibility of PEU and PCU were studied using a subcutaneous cage implant protocol. The results from the cage implant study and cell culture experiments indicated that monocytes adhere, differentiate, and fuse to form foreign body giant cells on both polyurethanes. It is now generally accepted that the reactive oxygen species released by these adherent macrophages and foreign body giant cells initiate PEU biodegradation. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared analysis of explanted samples provided evidence of chain scission and crosslinking in both polyurethanes. This indicated that the PCU was also susceptible to biodegradation by agents released from adherent cells. These results reinforce the need to evaluate and understand the biodegradation mechanisms of PCUs.",
        "Premature neonates who spend time in a neonatal intensive care unit may be at increased risk of adverse health effects from exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) because of their increased risk of high exposure, their small body size, and their physical condition. DEHP, a reproductive toxicant in animals, is a major component in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, which are frequently used in medical tubing and blood storage bags. DEHP is not covalently bound to PVC, and it may be easily released from the PVC medical devices. The objective of this study was to determine whether premature infants who undergo medical procedures, such as blood transfusions, intravenous therapy, enteral and parenteral nutrition support, and dialysis, are at increased risk of exposure to DEHP than the general population. Because of their smaller size, children and especially premature and small infants may receive a larger dose of DEHP on a milligram per kilogram basis than adults when the same-size medical device is used for all ages.\nPremature neonates who seemed to have the potential to be on intravenous infusion for >2 weeks and were expected to survive were eligible for enrollment in the study. We assessed exposure to DEHP in 6 premature newborns by measuring in 41 urine samples the levels of 3 DEHP metabolites: mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (mEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (mEHHP), and mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (mEOHP).\nmEHHP and mEOHP were detected in all 41 urine samples, and mEHP was detected in 33. Because only 33 of the samples had detectable amounts for all 3 metabolites, statistical analyses were limited to those 33. The levels of all 3 DEHP metabolites varied widely, and the urinary mean and median concentrations of mEOHP and mEHHP were 1 order of magnitude higher than those for mEHP. Furthermore, the geometric mean urinary concentrations of mEOHP (1617 ng/mL), mEHHP (2003 ng/mL), and mEHP (100 ng/mL) in these 6 premature infants who underwent intensive therapeutic interventions were found to be severalfold higher than in the US general population (for mEHP, geometric mean in those 6 years and older was 3.43 ng/mL).\nThis study provides the first quantitative evidence confirming that newborns who undergo intensive therapeutic medical interventions are exposed to higher concentrations of DEHP than the general population. Although the overall benefits of medical procedures using PVC devices outweigh the risks associated with exposure to DEHP, more research is needed to determine whether infants and children who undergo intensive therapeutic interventions using DEHP-containing devices are at higher risk for altered health outcomes than infants and children who undergo similar treatments but are not potentially exposed to DEHP.",
        "Phthalates are a group of multifunctional chemicals used in consumer and personal care products, plastics, and medical devices. Laboratory studies show that some phthalates are reproductive and developmental toxicants. Recently, human studies have shown measurable levels of several phthalates in most of the U.S. general population. Despite their widespread use and the consistent toxicologic data on phthalates, information is limited on sources and pathways of human exposure to phthalates. One potential source of exposure is medications. The need for site-specific dosage medications has led to the use of enteric coatings that allow the release of the active ingredients into the small intestine or in the colon. The enteric coatings generally consist of various polymers that contain plasticizers, including triethyl citrate, dibutyl sebacate, and phthalates such as diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). In this article we report on medications as a potential source of exposure to DBP in a man who took Asacol [active ingredient mesalamine (mesalazine)] for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. In a spot urine sample from this man collected 3 months after he started taking Asacol, the concentration of monobutyl phthalate, a DBP metabolite, was 16,868 ng/mL (6,180 micro g/g creatinine). This concentration was more than two orders of magnitude higher than the 95th percentile for males reported in the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The patient's urinary concentrations of monoethyl phthalate (443.7 ng/mL, 162.6 micro g/g creatinine), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (3.0 ng/mL, 1.1 micro g/g creatinine), and monobenzyl phthalate (9.3 ng/mL, 3.4 micro g/g creatinine) were unremarkable compared with the NHANES 1999-2000 values. Before this report, the highest estimated human exposure to DBP was more than two orders of magnitude lower than the no observable adverse effect level from animal studies. Further research is necessary to determine the proportional contribution of medications, as well as personal care and consumer products, to a person's total phthalate burden.",

Drugs: RIP, nisin and rifampin.\nGraft infections were established in the dorsal subcutaneous tissue by implantation of 1 cm(2) sterile Dacron grafts, followed by topical bacterial inoculation: grafts were retrieved at 7 days. The study included a control group (without inoculation) and two series composed of five groups for each staphylococcal strain: one contaminated group that did not receive any antibiotic prophylaxis, three contaminated groups that received grafts soaked with 10 mg/l RIP, 10 mg/l nisin, 10 mg/l rifampin, or RIP+nisin. The main outcome measure was the extent of bacterial at graft harvest.\nThe bacterial counts for methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis on explanted grafts were 6.1+/-2.8x10(2), 7.8+/-3.0x10(3) and 5.5+/-2.9x10(4) for RIP, nisin and rifampin, respectively. RIP and nisin used in combination reduced the bacterial count to <10. The results for S. epidermidis were similar.\nRIP and nisin could be used in combination to coat medical devices to prevent drug resistant S. epidermidis infections.",
        "Although current artificial heart valves are life sustaining medical devices, improvements are still necessary to address deficiencies. Bioprosthetic valves have a compromised fatigue life, while mechanical valves have better durability but are prone to thromboembolic complications. A novel, one-piece, tricuspid valve, consisting of leaflets, stent and sewing ring, made entirely from the hydrogel, polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C), has been developed and demonstrated. This valve has three thin leaflets attached to a cylindrical stent. In order to approximate the complex shape of the surface of the natural heart valve leaflets, two different geometries have been proposed: revolution about an axis of a hyperboloid shape and revolution about an axis of an arc subtending (joining) two straight lines. The parameters of both geometries were examined based on a compromise between avoiding sharp curvature of leaflets and minimization of the central opening of the valve when closed. The revolution of an arc subtending two straight lines was selected as the preferred geometry since it has the benefit of a smaller central opening when the value of the maximum curvature for the leaflets is the same for each valve geometry. A cavity mold has been designed and constructed to form the PVA-C heart valve. The three leaflets were formed and integrated into the stent and sewing ring in a single process. Prototype heart valves were manufactured in the mold from a solution of PVA and water, by controlled freezing and thawing cycles.",
        "A more complete understanding of the raw materials used for making implant device materials becomes increasingly important in the medical device industry. Often such detailed information requires utilization of a combination of analytical techniques. In this work, we characterize a poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) material using on-line size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) techniques. Here, we obtain detailed molecular compositional information such as repeat units, end group chemistry, and identification of impurities in both the high and low mass range. SEC with light scattering, viscosity, and refractive index detection (triple detection) is used to obtain information on a small quantity of high mass impurity that was undetected by both SEC-ESI and MALDI MS techniques. SEC with triple detection measures absolute molecular weights and molecular weight distributions. We compare average molecular weight values of the implantable device polymer obtained by SEC with triple detection, SEC-ESI, and SEC-MALDI MS techniques.",
        "To review the risks of injury to children in the hospital setting and to provide an overview of the factors which influence the approach to hospital safety, including institutional liability, hospital accreditation, patient safety and risk management issues.\nFatal and nonfatal injuries to children in the hospital setting were identified using searches of the published literature and searches of incident, complaint and claims data sources, including regulatory agency databases, litigation and claims data, and medical device hazard databases. Canadian hospital law, accreditation, patient safety and risk management literature was reviewed and summarized.\nInjuries occur in over 1% of hospitalized children, and are typically due to falls. Serious injuries are infrequent; however, a significant number of fatal injuries have been reported, mostly involving entrapment in beds and cribs, but also due to choking, strangulation and electrocution. Hospitals are liable for injuries to patients and visitors occurring on their premises. Canadian accreditation standards include provisions for the safety of equipment, supplies, medical devices and space, but do not provide specific guidance for children. Addressing injury hazards to children is an important aspect of the new patient safety movement, and falls within the scope of existing risk management and quality improvement programs.\nMost hazards to children in the hospital setting can be easily corrected by proactively incorporating basic child safety principles. Paediatricians can play an important role in advocating for a safe hospital environment and should encourage administrators to consider child safety in routine hospital operation and policies.",

        "Blood trauma caused by medical devices is a major concern. Complications following the implantation/application of devices such as prosthetic heart valves, cannulae, blood pumps, tubing, and throttles lead to sublethal and lethal damage to platelets and erythrocytes. This damage is provided by the alterations in fluid dynamics, providing a mechanical load on the blood corpuscle's membrane by means of the shear stress. An appropriate quantification of the shear-induced hemolysis of artificial organs is thought to be useful in the design and development of such devices in order to minimize device-induced blood trauma. To date, a power-law mathematical relationship using the time of exposure of a blood corpuscle to a certain mechanical load and the shear stress itself (derived under the peculiar condition of uniform shear stress) has served as a basic model for the estimation of the damage to blood, investigated by means of numerical and/or experimental fluid dynamical techniques. The aim of the present article is to highlight the effect of a time-varying mechanical loading acting on blood cells based on the usual power-law model; furthermore, the effect of the loading history of a blood particle is discussed, showing how the past history of the shear acting on a blood corpuscle is not taken into account, as researchers have done until now. The need for a reassessment of the power-law model for potential blood trauma assessment is discussed by using a mathematical formulation based on the hypotheses of the existence of damage accumulation for blood with respect to time and with respect to shear stress, to be applied in complex flow fields such as the ones established in the presence of artificial organs.",
        "The association between specific blood flow patterns and blood behaviour through medical devices suggests that a Lagrangian study may be a useful instrument for the evaluation of the thrombogenic and/or hemolytic potential of certain devices' geometries and biomaterials. In this study a description of blood particle trajectories in terms of their spiral contents is proposed; such a mathematical description for blood spiral flow, computed along several pathlines, is tested for a quantitative determination of the spiralled motion of blood flow into two three-dimensional numerical models, having different design characteristics, of venous cannula inserted in a vessel. As the influence of vortical flow conditions have been observed to have both beneficial and detrimental influence on blood behaviour in terms of blood-device interaction, of the degradation of its components, and of the efficiency of mass-exchange (in red cells oxygenation and plasma filtration, for example), the herein proposed method for the description of spiral laminar motion may be a helpful instrument to build up a tool to investigate, for example, the existence of correlations between level of spiral flow and geometry (as in the present investigated test case), rather than the effects of blood-surface contact. The results obtained in this test case investigation, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed function for a quantitative analysis of spiral flow in medical devices.",
        "Intravascular catheters and urinary catheters are the 2 most commonly inserted medical devices in the United States, and they are likewise the two most common causes of nosocomially acquired bloodstream infection. Biofilm formation on the surfaces of indwelling catheters is central to the pathogenesis of infection of both types of catheters. The cornerstone to any preventive strategy of intravascular catheter infections is strict attention to infection control practices. Antimicrobial-impregnated intravascular catheters are a useful adjunction to infection control measures. Prevention of urinary catheter-associated infection is hindered by the numbers and types of organisms present in the periurethral area as well as by the typically longer duration of catheter placement. Antimicrobial agents in general have not been effective in preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infection in persons with long-term, indwelling urethral catheters. Preventive strategies that avoid the use of antimicrobial agents may be necessary in this population.",
        "Viruses are important causes of acute and chronic diseases in humans. Newer viruses are still being discovered and those that are already known are being incriminated in the aetiology of clinical conditions with hitherto unknown causes. Apart from frequently causing infections in the general community, many types of viruses are also significant nosocomial pathogens. While it is generally agreed that we underestimate the proportion of nosocomial infections that are viral, due to a lack of routine monitoring, viruses easily account for more than 30% of the cases of hospital-acquired infections in many paediatric settings. Indeed, the relative importance of viruses in this respect is increasing due to a number of societal and demographic changes as well as alterations in healthcare practices. Safe vaccines against many common nosocomial viral agents are currently unavailable while there is also a virtual lack of effective and affordable chemotherapy against them. There is, therefore, renewed emphasis on preventive strategies by better understanding of the relative importance of various vehicles in the nosocomial spread of viruses and by infection control using microbicides. This, in turn, has stimulated considerable interest in the development of formulations that are not only safer but which also have demonstrated activity against major types of nosocomial viral pathogens. Further, much work is now underway to design better methods to assess the virucidal activity of microbicides used to decontaminate hands, reusable medical devices and environmental surfaces in critical areas of healthcare settings. It is anticipated that these approaches will result in reducing the health and economic impact of nosocomial infections due to viruses.",
        "In France, endoscope maintenance regulations present some particularities in terms of the definitions and texts referring to the disinfection and sterilization of medical devices, with respect to the prion risk. The main measures specified are a double cleaning prior to disinfection, with some stipulations concerning the procedure itself, such as time limits, duration and rinsing. The use of aldehydes in cleaning products is prohibited and it is recommended that peracetic acid, or any chlorinated product, be used at the disinfection phase. For machines, the recycling of detergents or disinfectants is prohibited, and traceability procedures are mandatory. The French Agency for Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) is committed to providing standards that prevent any undesirable consequences for the patient, the operator or the equipment. All these measures will be described in a 'user's guide' intended for medical care units, to be released by the National Technical Committee on Nosocomial Infections (CTIN).",
        "Infection of medical devices causes significant morbidity and mortality and considerable research effort has been directed at solving this problem. The aim of this study was to assess the biological performance of a novel furanone compound that has potential as an anti-infective coating for medical devices. This study examined in vitro leukocyte response following exposure to the antibacterial 3-(1'-bromohexyl)-5-dibromomethylene-2(5H)-furanone and assessed the tissue response following subcutaneous implantation of the furanone compound covalently bound to polystyrene (PS). Peripheral human blood was exposed to furanones in solution for 1h and flow cytometry used to analyse viability and changes in expression of surface receptors CD11b/CD18 and CD44. Flow cytometry results from propidium iodide stained cell suspensions suggested that the leukocytes were viable after exposure to furanones in whole blood. No significant difference was found in the expression of CD11b/CD18 and CD44 between the furanone exposed samples and the negative control for neutrophils suggesting that the furanones themselves do not activate these leukocytes. The positive control lipopolysaccharide significantly up-regulated CD11b/CD18 and slightly down-regulated CD44 on both PMNs and monocytes. In vivo studies of the tissue response to furanone covalently bound to PS showed that there was no significant difference in cellularity of capsules surrounding the disk and no significant increase in myeloperoxidase expression. These results demonstrate negligible acute inflammatory response to synthetic brominated antibacterial furanones. Future studies will focus on chronic responses and examination of in vivo efficacy.",
        "A major barrier to the long-term use of medical devices is development of infection. Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most common bacterial isolates from these infections with biofilm formation being their main virulence factor. Currently, antibiotics are used as the main form of therapy. However with the emergence of staphylococcal resistance, this form of therapy is fast becoming ineffective. In this study, the ability of a novel furanone antimicrobial compound to inhibit S. epidermidis adhesion and slime production on biomaterials was assessed. Furanones were physically adsorbed to various biomaterials and bacterial load determined using radioactivity. Slime production was assessed using a colorimetric method. Additionally, the effect of the furanone coating on material surface characteristics such as hydrophobicity and surface roughness was also investigated. The results of this study indicated that there was no significant change in the material characteristics after furanone coating. Bacterial load on all furanone-coated materials was significantly reduced (p<0.001) as was slime production (p<0.001). There is a potential for furanone-coated biomaterials to be used to reduce medical device-associated infections.",
        "Phosphorylcholine (PC)-based polymers have been used in a variety of medical device applications to improve biocompatibility. The use of PC-based materials for biomaterials is associated with low protein adsorption, reduced complement activation, low inflammatory response and cell adhesion. For some medical device applications however, materials that support cell adhesion are also beneficial, allowing host interaction and encouraging full incorporation within the body. As previous studies have suggested that cell adhesion to materials is enhanced by the addition of charge, PC-based polymers have therefore been modified to incorporate various concentrations of cationic charge. In this study, the affect of cationic charge on a range of biological responses was investigated. In vitro assays have been used to assess the adsorption of protein onto the materials surface, the adhesion of mouse fibroblasts and rabbit corneal epithelial cells and the adhesion of human mononuclear cells and granulocytes. The results corroborate previous work showing that PC without charge significantly reduces protein adsorption, cell adhesion and inflammatory cell activation. The addition of cationic charge to PC polymers however, resulted in an increase in all of the above responses. This increase did not however, increase linearly with cationic monomer concentration. The differences in cell adhesion are discussed in terms of differences in protein adsorption, cytotoxicity and/or stability of the different cationic polymer coatings.",
        "Thrombomodulin (TM) serves as the endothelial cell receptor for thrombin and alters its characteristics from pro- to anticoagulant. Additionally, it promotes the formation of activated protein C. We evaluated the conservation of the overall outcome of these functions in recombinant TM linked to artificial surfaces by incubation with human whole blood in vitro. TM was covalently immobilized through poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacers onto thin films of poly(octadecene alt maleic anhydride) covering planar glass substrates. TM binding to the polymer films was achieved after active ester formation at the carboxylic acid terminus of the PEG spacers and thoroughly characterized by HPLC-based amino acid analysis, immunofluorescence and ellipsometry. TM-coated samples were incubated for 3h with freshly drawn whole human blood anticoagulated with heparin (5IU/ml) using in-house developed incubation systems. The substantially reduced activation of blood coagulation (TAT) for TM-coated samples correlates well with the degree of contact activation (bradykinin and FXIIa formation) while no significant effects were observed for the platelet activation (PF4). Further, complement activation (C5a levels), was strongly diminished at the TM-containing surfaces. We conclude that the suggested method for preparation of TM immobilization may serve to prepare model substrates for studies on TM interactions but similarly provides a promising coating strategy for blood contacting medical devices.",
        "In June of 2000, the U.K. Medical Device Agency recommended the removal of Trilucent implants as a precautionary maneuver in response to reports of local inflammatory reactions. This decision allowed the authors to operate on 115 consecutive patients between June of 2000 and January of 2001. On the preoperative examination, the authors found a very high incidence of rippling (66 percent), whereas capsular contracture was seen in only three patients (2.6 percent). Rippling was significantly more common in patients with subglandular implants. Five implants were found ruptured during the operation. This figure, together with the relative ease of implant breakage at removal, shows a premature deterioration of the implant shell. The authors also comment on implant bleeding, which seems common in this type of breast implant. The authors think that this is a possible cause for the rippling phenomenon, resulting from a reduction of the implant content. On the basis of these findings, the authors conclude that Trilucent implants are associated with a poor cosmetic outcome and a high rate of complications.",
        "Trilucent soybean oil-filled breast implants were initially announced as the ultimate prostheses for breast augmentation. However, after an increasing number of reports of local complications and hazardous metabolites attributable to lipid oxidation, first the United Kingdom Medical Devices Agency and later the Belgian National Ministry of Health urged all plastic surgeons to contact their patients and advise them to have the implants removed and, if desired, replaced with another type of prosthesis. In our plastic surgery department, 13 patients received bilateral implants with triglyceride-filled prostheses between February and July of 1996, for primary breast augmentation or replacement of previously implanted prostheses. For 12 of those 13 patients, the prostheses have been explanted, because of unilateral breast enlargement attributable to a ruptured prosthesis for five patients and following the recommendation of the Belgian National Ministry of Health for the other seven patients. Before explantation, all patients underwent standard clinical examinations, with assessments of breast shape, volume, and firmness. Blood analyses were performed, with a special focus on liver enzymes, as were urinalyses. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained before explantation; for two patients, the scans revealed a fluid level separating two liquid layers in an intact prosthesis. This is the first report of such a finding. The removed implants were examined for any damage or shell deterioration and for changes in color and viscosity, the weights and volumes were measured and compared with the initial values for the implanted prostheses, and complete biochemical analyses of the accumulated fluid in cases of ruptured prostheses and of the filler material in cases of intact prostheses were performed. This small but well-documented series illustrates the multitude of problems associated with triglyceride-filled implants, including bleeding of the triglyceride filler; shell deterioration, as indicated by a loss of texture and extreme fragility of the implant (with rupture or delamination with a simple finger touch); an increase in osmotic pressure exerted by the degraded filler material; progressive weakening of the outer silicone shell, with influx of plasma proteins of up to 750 kDa, eventually resulting in rupture of the prosthesis; a lack of oxidative stability and the formation of toxic oxidation products; a lack of biocompatibility, with the formation of insoluble organic soap-like material; and a pronounced inflammatory reaction. It is concluded that the sequential and/or simultaneous occurrence of (1) implant bleeding, (2) lipid infiltration of the silicone elastomer, and (3) inflammation attributable to oxidation products provides an overall explanation or unifying hypothesis for the wide variety of adverse events related to soybean oil-filled implants.",
        "There is no perfect disposable battery--one that will sit on the shelf for 20 years, then continually provide unlimited current, at a completely constant voltage until exhausted, without producing heat. There is no perfect rechargeable battery--one with all of the above characteristics and will also withstand an infinite overcharge while providing an equally infinite cycle life. There are only compromises. Every battery selection is a compromise between the ideally required characteristics, the advantages, and the limitations of each battery type. General selection of a battery type to power a medical device is largely outside the purview of the biomed. Initially, these are engineering decisions made at the time of medical equipment design and are intended to be followed in perpetuity. However, since newer cell types evolve and the manufacturer's literature is fixed at the time of printing, some intelligent substitutions may be made as long as the biomed understands the characteristics of both the recommended cell and the replacement cell. For example, when the manufacturer recommends alkaline, it is usually because of the almost constant voltage it produces under the devices' design load. Over time, other battery types may be developed that will meet the intent of the manufacturer, at a lower cost, providing longer operational life, at a lower environmental cost, or with a combination of these advantages. In the Obstetrical Doppler cited at the beginning of this article, the user had put in carbon-zinc cells, and the biomed had unknowingly replaced them with carbonzinc cells. If the alkaline cells recommended by the manufacturer had been used, there would have been the proper output voltage at the battery terminals when the [table: see text] cells were at their half-life. Instead, the device refused to operate since the battery voltage was below presumed design voltage. While battery-type substitutions may be easily and relatively successfully made in disposable applications (for example, zinc-air for alkaline--if it is cost-effective), this is absolutely forbidden for secondary cells. Because of the differing cell voltages, charge characteristics and overcharge tolerance between different types of secondary cells, substituting a nickel-cadmium battery pack for the more expensive lithium-ion pack (if it is physically able to fit into the battery compartment), might appear to save money (e.g. $50 vs. $100) but it would be very ill advised. Since the cell characteristics are very different, it would be downright fatal to anyone within the 'kill radius' when the pack explodes. Those outside the kill radius would receive chemical burns from the electrolyte. Substitutions of secondary cell battery packs are generally not a good idea for biomeds to engage in. These are engineering decisions best left to either aftermarket battery pack manufacturers or the medical device manufacturer as a design engineering change.",
        "Catheter-related infection in cancer patients remains an important health-care problem with major financial implications. During the last few years a better understanding of the pathogenesis of catheter-related infections and the interaction between microorganisms and catheter surfaces has emerged. Recently the influence of biofilm formation in catheter-related infections has been established. The development of biofilm by the colonizing microbes permits attachment of the organisms to the vascular access device and confers resistance to antibiotics and host defense mechanisms. Strategies to overcome the development of biofilm are being developed to prevent catheter- and other medical device-related infections.",
        "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen which poses a major threat to long-term-hospitalized patients and individuals with cystic fibrosis. The capacity of P. aeruginosa to form biofilms is an important requirement for chronic colonization of human tissues and for persistence in implanted medical devices. Various stages of biofilm formation by this organism are mediated by extracellular appendages, such as type IV pili and flagella. Recently, we identified three P. aeruginosa gene clusters that were termed cup (chaperone-usher pathway) based on their sequence relatedness to the chaperone-usher fimbrial assembly pathway in other bacteria. The cupA gene cluster, but not the cupB or cupC cluster, is required for biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces. In this study, we identified a gene (mvaT) encoding a negative regulator of cupA expression. Such regulatory control was confirmed by several approaches, including lacZ transcriptional fusions, Northern blotting, and transcriptional profiling using DNA microarrays. MvaT also represses the expression of the cupB and cupC genes, although the extent of the regulatory effect is not as pronounced as with cupA. Consistent with this finding, mvaT mutants exhibit enhanced biofilm formation. Although the P. aeruginosa genome contains a highly homologous gene, mvaU, the repression of cupA genes is MvaT specific. Thus, MvaT appears to be an important regulatory component within a complex network that controls biofilm formation and maturation in P. aeruginosa.",
        "The number of indwelling medical devices is escalating, and an increasing proportion of device-related infections are being caused by Candida spp. Candida spp. produce biofilms on synthetic materials, which facilitates adhesion of the organisms to devices and renders them relatively refractory to medical therapy. Management of device-related Candida infections can be challenging. Removal of the infected device is generally needed to establish cure of Candida infections of medical devices. However, since the pathogenesis of Candida bloodstream infection is complicated, more studies are necessary to determine the role of catheter exchange in patients with both gastrointestinal tract mucositis and indwelling catheters. The medical and economic impact of these infections is enormous.",
        "To study the interactions between Candida albicans and 12 other species of Candida and bacteria in biofilms.\nThe number of cells within growing biofilms in a polystyrene tube model was measured after adding C. albicans to preformed biofilms of other micro-organisms and vice versa. It was also measured after simultaneous biofilm formation of C. albicans and other micro-organisms. The number of cells of C. albicans within the growing biofilms decreased significantly (P < 0.05) when the fungus was added to preformed biofilms of Candida spp. and bacteria except, with C. parapsilosis, Torulopsis glabrata and the glycocalyx producer Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When C. parapsilosis, Staphylococcus epidermidis (nonglycocalyx producer) or Serratia marcescens was added to preformed biofilms of C. albicans, the number of cells of these micro-organisms increased in the growing biofilms.\nBiofilms of C. albicans are capable of holding other micro-organisms and more likely to be heterogeneous with other bacteria and fungi in the environment and on medical devices.\nRecognition of the heterogeneity of biofilm-associated organisms can influence treatment decisions, particularly in patients who do not respond to initial appropriate therapy.",
        "To determine whether a cellular phone would interfere with the operation of mechanical ventilators.\nLaboratory study.\nUniversity medical center.\nFourteen mechanical ventilators.\nWe evaluated change in operation and malfunction of the mechanical ventilators.\nThe cellular phone (Nokia 6120i) was computer controlled, operating at 828.750 MHz analog modulation. It was operated at 16, 40, 100, 250, and 600 mW, 30 cm from the floor and 30, 15, and <3 cm from all sides of each ventilator. Six of the 14 ventilators tested malfunctioned when a cellular phone at maximum power output was placed < or =15 cm from the device. None of these responses were considered immediately life threatening except for the response of the Puritan Bennett 840, which stopped ventilating when the cellular phone at maximum power output was placed < or =30 cm from the ventilator. One ventilator doubled the ventilatory rate and another increased the displayed tidal volume from 350 to 1033 mL. In one of the infant ventilators, displayed tidal volume increased from 21 to 100 mL. In another ventilator, the high respiratory rate alarm sounded but the rate had not changed.\nIn a controlled laboratory setting, cellular phones placed in close proximity to some commercially available intensive care ventilators can cause malfunctions, including irrecoverable cessation of ventilation. This is most likely to occur if the cellular phone is <30 cm from the device and ringing. Based on our data and the available literature, we believe it is reasonably safe to permit the use of cellular phones in the intensive care unit, as long as they are kept > or =3 feet from all medical devices. The current electromagnetic compatibility standards for mechanical ventilators are inadequate to prevent malfunction. Manufacturers should ensure that their products are not affected by wireless technology even when placed immediately next to the device.",
        "Infection of implanted medical devices by Gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus ssp. is a serious concern in the biomaterial community. In this research the application of low frequency ultrasound to enhance the activity of vancomycin against implanted Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms was examined. Polyethylene disks covered with a biofilm of S. epidermidis were implanted subcutaneously in rabbits on both sides of their spine. The rabbits received systemic vancomycin for the duration of the experiment. Following 24 h of recovery, one disk was insonated for 24 or 48 h while the other was a control. Disks were removed and viable bacteria counted. At 24 h of insonation, there was no difference in viable counts between control and insonated biofilms, while at 48 h of insonation there were statistically fewer viable bacteria in the insonated biofilm. The S. epidermidis biofilms responded favorably to combinations of ultrasound and vancomycin, but longer treatment times are required for this Gram-positive organism than was observed previously for a Gram-negative species.",
        "Successful cleaning of medical devices, such as flexible endocopes, has been recognized to be of major importance for effective processing. Washer-disinfectors (WD) are considered to be an important step in this direction. The cleaning process in WD, however, has only been partially assessed regarding its effectiveness, and therefore to study this in more detail, tests were carried out, according prEN ISO 15883, using transparent teflon tubes as test pieces (length 2 m). For each experiment three test pieces were contaminated with the 'German test soil' containing Enterococcus faecium in blood, two for the test and one as a control (no automatic cleaning). Automatic cleaning was performed with a Wassenburg WD 440. Ten cleaning agents were used. In addition the process was carried out with water alone. After automated cleaning, test pieces were assessed visually (four categories, range: very poor to excellent visible cleanliness) and microbiologically [log(10) reduction factor (RF)]. Each experiment was repeated three times. Using the WD water gave excellent visible cleanliness with a mean RF of 1.1+/-0.6. The same excellent visible cleanliness was obtained with seven cleaning processes: deconex 23 Neutrazym, Helimatic Cleaner enzymatic, Korsolex-Endo-Cleaner, Labomat E, neodisher mediclean, Thermosept ER, and Thermoton NR. Worse visible cleanliness was found with three cleaning processes: Olympus ETD Cleaner and neodisher FE led to adequate visible cleanliness, and the cleaning process with neodisher medizym led to poor visible cleanliness. Six cleaning processes reduced the test organism by RF>or=3, i.e. the reduction was significantly higher than after cleaning with water alone. No significant difference between use of water alone and the cleaning process was found with three cleaning processes: Olympus ETD Cleaner, neodisher mediclean, and Thermosept ER (range RF: 0.8-1.8; P > 0.05). The cleaning process with neodisher medizym yielded a significantly lower mean RF (P = 0.039) in comparison with water treatment alone. Both visible cleanliness and mean RF, varied indicating that the choice of cleaning process had a major impact on the overall result.",
        "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an underdiagnosed circulatory problem in the primary care setting. Individuals are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease; therefore, there is the need for a technique capable of early identification and detection of patients with PAD. The focus of this study was to compare the accuracy of a new operator-independent method of measuring ankle brachial index (ABI) with the traditional Doppler ultrasound method of determining ABI. In 246 limbs the authors compared ankle systolic pressures and ABI measured by a new automated oscillatory method called the ABIgram with those measured by standard Doppler ultrasound. In phase 1, the 2 methods for measuring ankle systolic pressure had a mean difference of 2 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 6.7 mm Hg. In phase 2 the mean difference was 3.1 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 5.1 mm Hg. Further, ABI as measured by the 2 methods fell within 1% and demonstrated a 5% error in reproducibility. These numbers pass the SP-10 standard for medical devices established by the FDA. The ABIgram module of the Vasocor Vascular Diagnostic Center offers primary care physicians the ability to rapidly obtain ABI measurements comparable to the standard technique. Further, the ABIgram may be operated by staff commonly found in the primary care setting.",
        "The European standardisation of health informatics in CEN/TC 251 started in 1990 with the now twenty national standards bodies as members and a political mandate from the European Union and EFTA. The start of the international work in ISO/TC 215 has been welcomed by Europe and there is a lot of co-operation where European pre-standards have often been the basis for the start of international standards work, particularly in the area of medical device communication and for health cards. CEN and ISO also collaborate with other bodies in the field such as DICOM for imaging, IEEE for devices and the US based HL7 organisation for message development. It is important to find the right level of standards work for different aspects. The European CEN work will be maintained for issues like the electronic health record, some security aspects and medication related communication where there are common views and legislation makes European consensus necessary and achievable. The device market on the other hand requires global standards. In addition to multinational co-operation, it is important with a national strategy for the use of standards and adaptation and promotion of specific profiles to achieve interoperability in the still mainly national health systems.",
        "Because routine assays for pancreatic lipase catalytic activity are not yet standardized, between-method comparability is very poor. This is mainly due to the lack of reference materials (RMs). The aim of this study was to assign values of catalytic concentration to two human pancreatic lipase RMs, one prepared from human pancreatic juice (BCR 693), the other obtained by recombinant technology (BCR 694). Lipase catalytic activity was assayed in five experienced laboratories, using aliquots from the same lot of triolein emulsion and a standardized titrimetric procedure, optimized with regard to substrate, cofactors and pH. The accepted sets of data (n = 4) gave a mean +/- the corresponding uncertainty expressed as the 0.95 confidence interval of 1732 +/- 72 U/l and 1043 +/- 60 U/l for BCR 693 and 694, respectively. Transferability of the whole operating procedure proved to be quite satisfactory. The authors conclude that both RMs can be used to verify the correct implementation of the standardized measurement procedure and to assign values to secondary lipase materials (commercial calibrators, control products) which, in turn, ensures traceability to the standardized procedure in this study, and contributes to the harmonization of laboratory results according to the Directive for in vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices.",
        "The increasing use of single use medical devices is being driven by a growing awareness of iatrogenic (from the Greek; caused by the doctor) and nosocomial infections. Public health perceptions relating to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, specifically variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B are high on the political agenda and a matter of concern to healthcare professionals.",
        "The performance of biomedical implant devices is often limited by inappropriate tissue responses associated with synthetic materials used in device construction. Adverse healing responses, in particular the lack of an extensive vascular supply in the peri-implant tissue, are believed to lead to the ultimate failure of many of these medical devices. Accelerated formation of new blood vessels in the peri-implant tissue and within porous polymeric implants is hypothesized to improve the performance of such biomedical implant devices. The current study evaluated the use of cell-mediated, extracellular matrix modification of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) to increase vessel growth in peri-implant tissue and within the pores of the implants. Discs of ePTFE were modified through cell-mediated matrix deposition using epithelial and endothelial cell lines with variable deposition of collagen types, fibronectin, and laminin types. Cell matrix-modified discs, Matrigel-coated discs, and nonmodified discs were implanted in both the adipose and subcutaneous tissues of the rat. Following a 5-week implant period, samples were removed and evaluated histologically and morphometrically for the presence of blood vessels in the peri-implant tissue and within the pores of the polymer as well as for the presence of activated macrophages and monocytes. A significantly increased presence of activated macrophages and monocytes was associated only with the samples modified with the matrix from a human microvessel endothelial cell line. Increased vessel density was identified in association with those ePTFE samples modified with either the 804-G, HaCaT, or II-4 cell matrices, all of which have extracellular matrices enriched in the protein laminin-5.",

        "A silicone adjustable gastric banding system was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June, 2001. The purpose of this report is to review and characterize the reports on silicone adjustable gastric banding systems received by the FDA through August 8, 2002. We also review medical literature on adverse events with silicone adjustable gastric banding systems. Manufacturers of regulated medical devices, such as adjustable silicone gastric bands, are required to report adverse events, including deaths and serious injuries, to the FDA. We reviewed all such reports received by the FDA through August 8, 2002, for adjustable silicone gastric bands and summarize the data by type of adverse event, reported device problems, and reported patient problems. The FDA received 556 reports of adverse events related to the use of adjustable silicone gastric bands. Two of these reports were for deaths, one during surgery and the other as a result of an erosion of the gastric band into the stomach 9 weeks after implantation. Forty-four reports were for injuries including band erosions, slippage, and infection. The most common type of report (499) was for device malfunction, and of these, 485 (97.2%) described a leak at or near the port. Of the 485 leaks reported as malfunctions, 99.4% were treated surgically. The majority of reports were related to disconnection, breakage, and leakage at or near the access port. Physicians and potential patients should be aware of these problems and recognize the possibility that additional surgery(ies) may be required for leaking access port/connections. The loose connection may cause pain and the device no longer performs as intended when there is a leak.",
        "Each year, healthcare facilities are confronted with hundreds of medical device hazard reports and recalls. To ensure that appropriate actions are taken in response to all such reports, facilities must have an effective medical device hazard and recall management program in place. Such a program should ensure that hazard and recall information is received and communicated to the appropriate personnel and that the required action is taken and documented. This Guidance Article was developed to serve as a resource for healthcare facilities that wish to set up--or, more likely, refine--a hazard and recall management program. We have divided the discussion into three sections: The first part of this article addresses the role that hazards and recalls play in improving patient safety, focusing on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) role in the recall process and on healthcare facilities' responsibility to deal with hazards and recalls. The second part guides hospitals through the process of setting up an effective in-house hazard and recall management program. In the final section, we review some of the ECRI resources and tools you can use to develop and refine your program.",
        "The issue of whether restraints should be used in nursing home settings in order to reduce the number of injuries resulting from falls remains controversial on a world-wide basis. In this Dutch study, the care of 265 residents was examined. It was found that restraints were used with 49 per cent of residents, the most frequently encountered being bed rails, belts, and 'geriatric' chairs with a table attached. The most common reason given by nursing staff for the use of restraints was the prevention of falls, followed by a need to control restlessness, and to allow the safe use of medical devices. A novel aspect of this study was that four members of staff volunteered to experience the use of restraints for themselves during a 24- hour period. They reported a complete absence of privacy and freedom of movement, together with physical discomfort. The authors conclude that there is a need to review the use of such restraints in all their aspects.",
        "Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate or DEHP is a colorless, oily liquid and notably, with respect to clinical concerns, is soluble in blood and body fluids containing lipoproteins. Despite being listed as a possible human carcinogen in the 1980's, more recent concerns have focused on its potential toxicity as a result of leaching from medical devices into patients via intravenous or enteral routes. Initial discussion of this problem was reported in the medical literature over 20 years ago. This article provides an update on the status of DEHP as a potential reproductive toxin and the potential implications for high-risk population groups (most notably neonates). The use of the precautionary principle for a guidepost in relating human exposure effects to chemical agents, including DEHP, has become a topic relevant to all health care professionals and is discussed herein.",
        "Implanted biomaterials are coated immediately with host plasma constituents, including extracellular matrix (ECM); this reaction may be undesirable in some cases. Poly(L-lysine)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLL-g-PEG) has been shown to spontaneously adsorb from aqueous solution onto metal oxide surfaces, effectively reducing the degree of non-specific adsorption of blood and ECM proteins, and decreasing the adhesion of fibroblastic and osteoblastic cells to the coated surfaces. Cell adhesion through specific peptide-integrin receptors could be restored on surfaces coated with PLL-g-PEG functionalized with peptides of the RGD (Arg-Asp-Gly) type. To date, no study has examined the effect of surface modifications by PLL-g-PEG-based polymers on bacterial adhesion. The ability of Staphylococcus aureus to adhere to the ECM and plasma proteins deposited on biomaterials is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of medical-device-related infections. This study describes methods for visualizing and quantifying the adhesion of S. aureus to smooth and rough (chemically etched) titanium surfaces without and with monomolecular coatings of PLL-g-PEG, PLL-g-PEG/PEG-RGD and PLL-g-PEG/PEG-RDG. The different surfaces were exposed to S. aureus cultures for 1-24h and bacteria surface density was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Coating titanium surfaces with any of the three types of copolymers significantly decreased the adhesion of S. aureus to the surfaces by 89-93% for PLL-g-PEG, and 69% for PLL-g-PEG/PEG-RGD. Therefore, surfaces coated with PLL-g-PEG/PEG-RGD have the ability to attach cells such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts while showing reduced S. aureus adhesion, resulting in a selective biointeraction pattern that may be useful for applications in the area of osteosynthesis, orthopaedic and dental implantology.",
        "We have been using the Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC) since 1997 as one choice of cerebral aneurysm treatment.We have, at the present time, two effective radical treatment methods for acutely ruptured cerebral aneurysms, GDC embolization and conventional surgical aneurysmal neck clipping. There ensued questions about the cost and efficacy of the two strategies. Retrospective analysis was done on a GDC group and a clipping group, with each twenty consecutive patients. The features of the GDC group patients were higher age, and poorer Hunt and Kosnik grades than the other group. All MCA aneurysms were treated with surgical neck clipping, while all the posterior circulation aneurysms were embolized with GDC. Based on the Japanese Medical Insurance and Payment System, 477,890 points (1 point = yen 10) as a mean was required with the GDC group, and 456,084 points with the neck clipping group, showing no significant difference between the two groups. In the GDC group, the cost of the implanted medical device seemed to raise the total medical expense. At present, the GDC embolization is the preferred choice of strategies in acutely ruptured cerebral aneurysms, and its preference increases in the surgically difficult cases, very old, or poor grade patients, and in various complicated cases. And, the GDC embolization seems to be satisfactory from the medico-financial viewpoint.",
        "We introduce our training tools and system of neurovascular intervention. An in vitro cerebral vascular model was used for the young residents to understand the basic interventional techniques and devices. The model included several vascular lesions such as cerebral aneurysm, dural arterio-venous fistula, or carotid artery stenosis. Endovascular procedures in the model were performed under fluoroscopic or direct visual control, and consecutive haemodynamic changes were visualized by using digital subtraction angiography and direct observation. Thus, traineess could have an easy understanding of clinical conditions. New medical devices, such as platinum coils, were successfully implanted in the model under stable conditions. After the initial training using vascular model, the residents had started clinical experiences under the control of senior surgeons. Although it is difficult to describe usefulness of our clinical training, we believe that we provide enough good quality and quantity of clinical cases to the residents. Because our endovascular team has recently had150-200 interventional procedures every year, one resident can have experienced more than 100 cases per year. The qualification of a Board Certified Specialist of the Japanese Society of Intravascular Neurosurgery (JSIN) requires that the applicant must have experienced more than 100 cases for four years. So our residents can have enough case materials to qualify the board examination.",

        "Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is used as a plastic softener in the polymer industry and is widespread in medical devices. DEHP has been incriminated as an endocrine-disrupting chemical, and the effects of DEHP in various species have included disturbances in the reproductive system. The effects of the chemical have varied, depending upon exposure routes and species. This study was performed in order to characterise the kinetics of DEHP and its metabolite mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) in the young male pig, an omnivore model-species for research in reproductive toxicology. Eight pigs were given 1000 mg DEHP/kg bodyweight by oral gavage. The concentrations of DEHP and MEHP were then measured in the plasma and tissues of the pigs at different time points after administration. There was no consistent rise above contamination levels of concentrations of DEHP in the plasma of the pigs. However, the metabolite MEHP reached the systemic blood circulation. The half-life of MEHP in the systemic blood circulation was calculated to be 6.3 h. Absorption from the intestine was biphasic in six of the eight pigs and the mono-exponential elimination-phase started 16 h after the after the administration of DEHP. To conclude, MEHP consistently reaches the systemic circulation in the pig when DEHP is administered orally. The kinetic pattern of the parent substance on the other hand is more difficult to characterise.",
        "Staphylococcus epidermidis is a major nosocomial pathogen, even though it is a member of the normal bacterial flora of skin and the mucous membranes. A major complication is the development of biofilms on implanted medical devices. Diagnosis of coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections relies on the presence of clinical manifestation of infections and on microbiologic evidence, usually obtained after the removal of the biomaterial. Solid-phase immunoassays have not yet been used for routine diagnosis of coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections and distinction between pathogenic and normal cocci. The enzyme immunoassays developed in the last decade are presented in this review article. Serodiagnosis has been attempted by determining antibodies against bacterial cells, mixtures of S. epidermidis slime antigens and discrete slime antigens. Detection or typing of staphylococcal cells has been performed by specific antibodies and lectins. There is still a long way until the application of such assays in the routine clinical laboratory and large clinical studies are necessary.",
        "We describe a new percutaneous minimally invasive spinal fixation system based on pedicle screws and inflatable rods. The rods are inserted in a flexible state and harden following deployment. We test this system in terms of biocompatibility, ferromagnetism, magnetic resonance artifact production, bench top mechanical testing, ease of insertion within cadavers, potential thermal damage to paraspinous muscles in pigs, and long-term device tolerability in sheep.\nTo determine the safety and utility of this system before its use in human subjects.\nComposite materials and epoxy compounds have been used safely in a variety of implanted medical devices for years with no signs of systemic toxicity or significant device failures.\nLong-term biocompatibility test of system components was conducted according to International Standards Organization 10993 and Food and Drug Administration Blue Book Memorandum #G95-1 standards. Device components were assessed for magnetic deflection and torque and imaged in a 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance unit. Full constructs of the system were tested for compression strength, torque, and fatigue per American Society for Testing and Materials F1717 standards. The system was deployed using C-arm fluoroscopic guidance in 11 cadavers and 2 live sheep. Further, the inflatable rods were tested for exothermic damage to paraspinous musculature in 2 pigs.\nAll system components were found to be biocompatible, nonferromagnetic, and produce little magnetic resonance artifact. Compression and torque results for the new system were found to be comparable to standard metallic pedicle screw and rod fixation systems. However, the new system displayed a superior modulus of elasticity relative to standard surgical systems. The new system endured 5 million cycles of repetitive compressions without breakage or significant wear. All cadaver and sheep insertions were performed successfully. Sheep suffered no complications, and minimal blood loss occurred during device insertions. One of the animals killed at 6 months demonstrated no internal organ damage. The self-curing version of polymer used to inflate the flexible rods cured to approximately 53% of its final strength in 90 minutes with maximum external rod temperature of 40.5 C. and no adjacent thermal damage within porcine paraspinous musculature.\nThe new spinal fixation system is biocompatible, uses a nontoxic polymer, is magnetic resonance compatible, displays favorable biomechanical characteristics, can be easily deployed percutaneously using simple fluoroscopic guidance, is well tolerated in living sheep, caused no muscular thermal damage, and could be used in humans within a reasonable operative time frame. The new system demonstrates the feasibility of percutaneously constructing composite structures in situ within the body.",
        "Between 1998 and 2000 an Expert Panel convened by the National Toxicology Program's Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction (NTP-CERHR) reviewed information related to the developmental and reproductive toxicity of seven phthalate esters; DBP, BBP, DnHP, DEHP, DnOP, DINP, and DIDP. Information on exposures was also considered. The objectives were to determine whether any of these phthalates posed potential human reproductive risks, and if so, to define the circumstances. The Expert Panel also identified some areas of uncertainty. These assessments, ultimately published in 2002, concluded that reproductive risks were minimal to negligible in most cases although some specific uses were considered potentially more problematic. Since the evaluations were completed, numerous studies dealing with both hazard characterization and underlying mechanism have been carried out. Additionally, exposures of the general population have been much better characterized through the use of urinary measurements developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This additional information makes several important points. First, calculations based on the urinary metabolite measurements indicate that exposures within the general population are at levels similar to or lower than the estimates used by the NTP-CERHR. The demonstration that exposures were not underestimated by the CERHR has removed a substantial portion of the uncertainty. Second, new hazard characterization studies on several phthalates have established NOAELs similar to or higher than those used by the Expert Panel. Thus, these data demonstrate that, to the extent that the rodent data are useful for human health risk assessment, the no effect levels and dose-response relationships are now more precisely defined. In some cases, the no effect levels may be substantially higher than those estimated by the Expert Panel. Third, studies of underlying mechanism and/or hazard characterization studies in other species suggest that primates may be less sensitive than rodents to the reproductive effects of certain phthalates. Finally, the two specific situations that the CERHR identified as potentially problematic, the exposure of young children to DINP through the use of toys or to DEHP from medical devices, have been assessed by the responsible regulatory authorities. The Consumer Product Safety Commission concluded that exposure to DINP from toys was well below effect levels in animals, and, therefore, there was no risk. The Food and Drug Administration estimates of exposures from medical devices indicated that for some limited, intensive medical procedures, DEHP exposures could be similar to or greater than the NOAELs selected by the NTP-CERHR. However, the FDA also acknowledged that more recent information indicates that the NOAELs identified in rodent studies may be substantially higher than values previously proposed by the NTP-CERHR. In summary, much of the uncertainty identified by the CERHR has now been addressed, and the overall conclusions that levels of concern are minimal to negligible in most situations are much better established. The overall objective of this report is to summarize this new research and comment on its relevance to the NTP-CERHR assessments.",
        "Since the mid-1970s the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay has been used to test medical devices for bacterial endotoxins. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) recently published a standard designated ANSI/AAMI ST 72: 2002, Bacterial Endotoxins--Test methodologies, routine monitoring, and alternatives to batch testing, which addresses LAL testing and associated issues. In order to perform the bacterial endotoxins test (BET), the test article must be extracted in an aqueous medium, with the extract being used as the test solution. In the early years of testing, and periodically throughout LAL test history, questions have arisen about validation of the extraction efficiency of endotoxins from medical devices. The AAMI Microbiological Methods Committee appointed a Task Group to thoroughly research the issue of extraction efficiency and to recommend whether validation of extraction efficiency is necessary for LAL testing of medical devices.",

        "Adenoviral (Ad) vectors feature attractive characteristics for gene therapy of a wide variety of diseases. In many cases, the Ad vector must be administered using catheters and other plastic medical devices. Although poly(vinyl chloride) is one of the most frequently used catheter materials, it is relatively rigid and requires the addition of a plasticizer such as di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) to increase its flexibility. In this study, we demonstrated that exposure to a DEHP-containing catheter decreased the infectivity of Ad vectors but not the total particle number of the vector. Loss of Ad vector infectivity was directly related to the time of exposure to the DEHP-containing catheter, but it was not due to simple leaching of the chemical from the plastic. The loss of Ad vector infectivity could be prevented by preflushing the tube with albumin. Careful consideration of the compatibility between gene therapy vectors and medical delivery devices will be critical to the success of human gene therapy applications.",

A single-centre, qualitative, descriptive, non-comparative study was carried out to evaluate the tolerance, acceptability and efficacy of Urgotul in practice. Urgotul comprises a new concept in wound management: lipido-colloid technology. It is a class IIb medical device and takes the form of a non-occlusive, thin-sheet, lipido-colloid dressing. Twenty-two out of 27 hospital inpatients who were selected by the tissue viability nurse and vascular nurse completed the study. Informed written consent was obtained before inclusion and photography of the wounds. Wounds were photographed and traced on entry, at each dressing change and on exit. The clinical report forms were completed weekly until wounds healed, or up to a maximum of 4 weeks. Patient and nurse acceptability was documented weekly and on exit from the study. The results were very positive regarding ease of application, conformability and non-adherence, absence of trauma, pain and bleeding on removal, with minimal maceration of the surrounding skin and odour. The study involved a limited sample of patients but demonstrated good efficacy, tolerance and acceptability of the dressing in a wide range of acute and chronic wounds.",

        "Prions are extremely resistant to disinfection and sterilization methods used so far. The pathogenic prion protein core (called prion) consists of 142 amino-acids, is resistant to proteolytic enzymes, has a mass of 15 pikograms and is filtrable. Fixed by desiccation or chemicals may retain infectivity for years. It survives dry heat at 200 degrees C for 1-2 hours. Prions are fixed to stainless steel within minutes and remain infectious for long periods. Their pathogenetic properties depend on tertiary spatial structure (conformation) which is specific and transmissible in experiment. The prion decontamination appears by far the most important area of the prion science because very little, or nothing, has been done in the majority of world hospitals to prevent iatrogenic transmission. The number of potentially infectious patients is not known. Therefore, patients undergoing neurosurgery, laryngeal or ophthalmic operations, orthodental treatments and even anaesthetic or endoscopic applications should be classified into risk groups, even if clinically priondisease inapparent. The use (or misuse) of disposable instruments is certainly not the final answer for all cases and classic decontamination procedures, if possible because of the character of medical devices, appear still of greatest importance. We consider the high pathogen safety (HPS) autoclave from FEDEGARI as the best actual equipment for the effective decontamination of prions in the hospital practice. The investment costs are moderate and the handling is simple but must be careful. It appears practicable even in small specialized units.",
        "In today's intensive care and surgery, a great number of cables are attached to patients. These cables can make the care and nursing of the patient difficult. Replacing them with wireless communications technology would facilitate patient care. Bluetooth is a modern radio technology developed specifically to replace cables between different pieces of communications equipment. In this study we sought to determine whether Bluetooth is a suitable replacement for cables in intensive care and during surgery with respect to electromagnetic compatibility. The following questions were addressed: Does Bluetooth interfere with medical equipment? And does the medical equipment decrease the quality of the Bluetooth communication? A Bluetooth link, simulating a patient monitoring system, was constructed with two laptops. The prototype was then used in laboratory and clinical tests according to American standards at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm. The tests, which included 44 different pieces of medical equipment, indicated that Bluetooth does not cause any interference. The tests also showed that the hospital environment does not affect the Bluetooth communication negatively.\nBluetooth, a new radio technology transmitting at 2.4 GHz, was tested in a clinical setting. The study showed that a single Bluetooth link was robust and electromagnetically compatible with the tested electronic medical devices.",

        "Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) have gained substantial interest as pathogens involved in nosocomial, particularly catheter-related infections. The pathogenic potential of CNS is mainly due to their capacity to form biofilms on indwelling medical devices. In a biofilm, the bacteria are protected against antibiotics and from attacks by the immune system. The factors contributing to biofilm formation are among the best-studied virulence factors of CNS and comprise factors involved in the adhesion to a catheter surface and in cell accumulation. CNS usually persist in the host in relative silence, but may cause sepsis, for which the recently found inflammatory peptides called phenol-soluble modulins are prime candidates. Many CNS also produce several lipases, proteases, and other exoenzymes, which possibly contribute to the persistence of CNS in the host and may degrade host tissue. We are also beginning to understand how regulators of virulence trigger the expression of virulence factors in CNS. A better conception of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity and the frequently encountered antibiotic resistance of CNS may help to develop novel, efficient anti-staphylococcal therapeutics.",
        "To develop a microbial test method to ascertain the passage of airborne bacteria through the medical device packaging system after sterilization, and to apply this test method to flexible packages under mechanical pressure changes.\nPetri dishes filled with nutrient agar were integrated into the packaging unit prior to sterilization. We examined paper packaging consisting of 1 (single-paper packaging [P]), 2 (double-paper packaging [PP] and textile and paper double packaging [TP]), and 3 (double packaging with transport packaging [TPP]) layers. After sterilization, the test packages were pressed five times per minute for 1 or 3 hours by a mechanical device weighing 1 kg. This exposure took place in rooms with an average airborne bacterial count of 35 (room 1) or 440 (room 2) CFU/m3. The packaging was opened following culture at 37 degrees C for 48 hours to determine the number of colonies formed.\nThe proportion of contaminated packages rose with the duration of mechanical stress and increased airborne bacteria concentration. Thus, mechanical pressure change for 3 hours resulted in the contamination of 60% (P), 15% (PP), 0% (TP), and 0% (TPP) of the packages in room 1, whereas 100% (P), 65% (PP), 73% (TP), and 0% (TPP) of the packages in room 2 were contaminated.\nThis test method allows sterile packaging systems to be tested for contamination under practical conditions without extensive laboratory preparation. Contamination as a result of laboratory errors can be ruled out almost certainly.",
        "The general population is exposed to phthalates through consumer products, diet, and medical devices. The present study explored whether phthalates, reproductive toxins in laboratory animals, were associated with altered sperm movement characteristics in men. Two-hundred twenty subjects provided a semen sample for computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) and a urine sample for measurement of phthalate monoesters, monoethyl (MEP), monobenzyl (MBzP), mono-n-butyl (MBP), mono-2-ethylhexyl (MEHP), and monomethyl (MMP). Three CASA parameters, straight-line velocity (VSL), curvilinear velocity (VCL), and linearity (LIN), were used as measures of sperm progression, sperm vigor, and swimming pattern, respectively. There were suggestive dose-response relationships (shown as the predicted change in mean sperm motion parameter for the second and third tertiles compared with the first tertile; P value for trend) for MBzP with VSL (-2.36 microm/s, -2.81 microm/s; P =.09) and VCL (-1.67 microm/s, -2.45 microm/s; P =.4). There were suggestive negative associations between MBP and VSL (-3.07 microm/s, -2.87 microm/s; P =.08) and VCL (-3.25 microm/s, -3.46 microm/s; P =.2), and between MEHP with VSL (-1.09 microm/s, -2.73 microm/s; P =.1) and VCL (-0.29 microm/s, -2.93 microm/s; P =.3). In contrast to the other phthalates, MEP was positively associated with VSL and VCL but negatively associated with LIN. No consistent relationship was found for MMP and any sperm motion parameter. Although we did not find statistically significant associations, trends between CASA parameters, sperm velocity, and forward progression, and increased urinary levels of MBP, MBzP, and MEHP warrant further follow-up.",
        "Polysaccharides are becoming increasingly developed as therapeutics and medical products, as the new field of Glycomics expands. Glycosaminoglycans that contain N-acetyl glucosamine constituents have been the focus of research leading to medical devices. A new hemostatic bandage, the Syvek Patch, has been introduced in the recent past for the control of bleeding at vascular access sites in interventional cardiology and radiology procedures. This product consists of poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (pGlcNAc) isolated in a unique fiber crystalline structural form from the large-scale culture and processing of a marine diatom. The Syvek pGlcNAc fiber material has chemical, physical, and biological properties that result in its favorable performance as a hemostat. Two new products, the Clo-Sur PAD and ChitoSeal, have recently become available also as patch hemostats. These two products both use chitosan, another N-acetyl glucosamine containing glycosaminoglycan, as their active ingredient. Structural, chemical, and biological comparisons of Syvek pGlcNAc and chitosan reveal a number of important differences. Syvek pGlcNAc fibers contain approximately 50 fully acetylated, high molecular weight pGlcNAc molecules in a crystalline, three-dimensional beta structure array, and are insoluble. Chitosan is a low molecular weight mixed amorphous cationic polymer with no regular structure as a solid, and is water-soluble taking on a random coil configuration when in solution. These structural dissimilarities result in differences in the hemostatic properties of the two materials. Syvek pGlcNAc is able to significantly reduce the in vitro fibrin clot formation time of platelet-rich plasma samples and has the ability to cause aggregation of red blood cells in vitro. Chitosan is no better than gauze or other controls in these in vitro assays. The Syvek Patch is able to control the bleeding and cause hemostasis in a coagulopathic swine spleen-bleeding animal model 100% of the time, whereas Clo-Sur PAD was completely unsuccessful (0%) and ChitoSeal (25%) was worse than a gauze pad control (50%) in the same model. Syvek pGlcNAc fibers have structural and chemical properties that provide a unique basis for their ability to interact with blood components to cause hemostasis. Chitosan does not have the same properties and capabilities.",
        "Staphylococcus epidermidis is a normal constituent of the healthy human microflora, but it is also the most common cause of nosocomial infections associated with the use of indwelling medical devices. Isolates from device-associated infections are known for their pronounced phenotypic and genetic variability, and in this study we searched for factors that might contribute to this flexibility. We show that mutator phenotypes, which exhibit elevated spontaneous mutation rates, are rare among both pathogenic and commensal S. epidermidis strains. However, the study revealed that, in contrast to those of commensal strains, the genomes of clinical S. epidermidis strains carry multiple copies of the insertion sequence IS256, while other typical staphylococcal insertion sequences, such as IS257 and IS1272, are distributed equally among saprophytic and clinical isolates. Moreover, detection of IS256 was found to be associated with biofilm formation and the presence of the icaADBC operon as well as with gentamicin and oxacillin resistance in the clinical strains. The data suggest that IS256 is a characteristic element in the genome of multiresistant nosocomial S. epidermidis isolates that might be involved in the flexibility and adaptation of the genome in clinical isolates.",
        "Medical-grade poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) was chemically modified to study how the incorporation of monovalent silver influences Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion and colonization. The modification investigated consisted of a radio frequency-oxygen (RF-O(2)) glow discharge pre-functionalization, followed by a two-step wet-treatment in sodium hydroxide and silver nitrate solutions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and contact angle measurements were used to investigate the chemical nature and surface wettability of the films following each step of the modification. XPS analysis proved that the RF-O(2) plasma pre-functionalization of native PVC reproducibly increased the amount of functional groups representative of PVC additives, including ether/alcohol, esters and carboxyl groups. More specifically, we demonstrated that the O-C=O groups representative of the phthalic ester and zinc carboxylate additives identified for native PVC increased by two-fold following the RF-O(2) plasma pre-functionalization step. Although RF-O(2) pre-functionalization did not have an effect on the silver content of the NaOH/AgNO(3) treated substrates, such a modification was necessary for biomaterial products that did not have reproducible surfaces amongst production lots. XPS analysis also demonstrated that saponification with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) of esters, like those of the phthalic ester additives of PVC is a simple, irreversible method of hydrolysis, which produced sodium carboxylate and sodium phthalate salts. Exposure of native PVC to NaOH resulted in an increased surface hydrophilicity (from ca 90 degrees to ca 60 degrees ) due to dechlorination. XPS analysis following further incubation in silver nitrate demonstrated that silver ions can be trapped when the sodium of sodium carboxylate is replaced by silver after performing a second treatment with a monovalent silver-containing solution. The creation of silver salt on native PVC resulted in an ultra-hydrophobic (>120 degrees ) surface. The chemical modifications using NaOH and AgNO(3) wet treatments completely inhibited bacterial adhesion of four strains of P. aeruginosa to both native and oxygen-pre-functionalized PVC, and efficiently prevented colonization over longer periods (72 h). Our results suggest that surface modifications that incorporate silver ions would be extremely effective at reducing bacterial colonization to medical devices.",
        "Poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) has been used as a bioresorbable polymer in numerous medical devices as well as for tissue engineering applications. Its main advantage is its biocompatibility and slow degradation rate. PCL surface, however, is hydrophobic and cell-biomaterial interaction is not the best. We attempt for the first time to modify an ultra thin PCL surface with collagen. The PCL film was prepared using solvent casting and biaxial stretching technique developed in our laboratory. This biaxial stretching produced an ultra thin PCL 3-7 microm thick, ideal for membrane tissue engineering applications. The PCL film was pretreated using Argon plasma, and then UV polymerized with acrylic acid (AAc). Collagen immobilization was then carried out. The modified film surface was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Water contact angles were also measured to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the modified surface. Results showed that the hydrophilicity of the surface has improved significantly after surface modification. The water contact angle dropped from 66 degrees to 32 degrees. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) showed an increase in roughness of the film. A change from 46 to 60 nm in the surface morphology was also observed. The effect of cells attachment on the PCL film was studied. Human dermal fibroblasts and myoblasts attachment and proliferation were improved remarkably on the modified surface. The films showed excellent cell attachment and proliferation rate.",

        "Although adverse drug events have been extensively evaluated by computer-based surveillance, medical device errors have no comparable surveillance techniques.\nTo determine whether computer-based surveillance can reliably identify medical device-related hazards (no known harm to patient) and adverse medical device events (AMDEs; patient experienced harm) and to compare alternative methods of detection of device-related problems.\nThis descriptive study was conducted from January through September 2000 at a 520-bed tertiary teaching institution in the United States with experience in using computer tools to detect and prevent adverse drug events. All 20 441 regular and short-stay patients (excluding obstetric and newborn patients) were included.\nMedical device events as detected by computer-based flags, telemetry problem checklists, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge code (which could include AMDEs present at admission), clinical engineering work logs, and patient survey results were compared with each other and with routine voluntary incident reports to determine frequencies, proportions, positive predictive values, and incidence rates by each technique.\nOf the 7059 flags triggered, 552 (7.8%) indicate a device-related hazard or AMDE. The estimated 9-month incidence rates (number per 1000 admissions [95% confidence intervals]) for AMDEs were 1.6 (0.9-2.5) for incident reports, 27.7 (24.9-30.7) for computer flags, and 64.6 (60.4-69.1) for ICD-9 discharge codes. Few of these events were detected by more than 1 surveillance method, giving an overall incidence of AMDE detected by at least 1 of these methods of 83.7 per 1000 (95% confidence interval, 78.8-88.6) admissions. The positive predictive value of computer flags for detecting device-related hazards and AMDEs ranged from 0% to 38%.\nMore intensive surveillance methods yielded higher rates of medical device problems than found with traditional voluntary reporting, with little overlap between methods. Several detection methods had low efficiency in detecting AMDEs. The high rate of AMDEs suggests that AMDEs are an important patient safety issue, but additional research is necessary to identify optimal AMDE detection strategies.",
        "There are many medical devices used for head, neck, and spinal diseases and injuries, and new devices are constantly being introduced. Many of the newest devices are variations on a previous theme. Knowing the specific name of a device is not important. It is important to recognize the presence of a device and to have an understanding of its function as well as to be able to recognize the complications associated with its use. The article discusses the most common and important devices of the head, neck, and spine, including cerebrospinal fluid shunts and the Codman Hakim programmable valve; subdural drainage catheters, subdural electrodes, intracranial electrodes, deep brain stimulators, and cerebellar electrodes; coils, balloons, adhesives, particles, and aneurysm clips; radiation therapy catheters, intracranial balloons for drug installation, and carmustine wafers; hearing aids, cochlear implants, and ossicular reconstruction prostheses; orbital prostheses, intraocular silicone oil, and lacrimal duct stents; anterior and posterior cervical plates, posterior cervical spine wiring, odontoid fracture fixation devices, cervical collars and halo vests; thoracic and lumbar spine implants, anterior and posterior instrumentation for the thoracic and lumbar spine, vertebroplasty, and artificial disks; spinal column stimulators, bone stimulators, intrathecal drug delivery pumps, and sacral stimulators; dental and facial implant devices; gastric and tracheal tubes; vagus nerve stimulators; lumboperitoneal shunts; and temperature- and oxygen-sensing probes.",
        "This paper introduces an extended hierarchical task analysis (HTA) methodology devised to evaluate and compare user interfaces on volumetric infusion pumps. The pumps were studied along the dimensions of overall usability and propensity for generating human error. With HTA as our framework, we analyzed six pumps on a variety of common tasks using Norman's Action theory. The introduced method of evaluation divides the problem space between the external world of the device interface and the user's internal cognitive world, allowing for predictions of potential user errors at the human-device level. In this paper, one detailed analysis is provided as an example, comparing two different pumps on two separate tasks. The results demonstrate the inherent variation, often the cause of usage errors, found with infusion pumps being used in hospitals today. The reported methodology is a useful tool for evaluating human performance and predicting potential user errors with infusion pumps and other simple medical devices.",

        "The possibility that exposures to environmental agents are associated with reproductive disorders in human populations has generated much public interest recently. Phthalate esters are used most commonly as plasticizers in the food and construction industry, and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most abundant phthalate in the environment. Daily human exposure to DEHP in the U.S. is significant, and occupational and clinical exposures from DEHP-plasticized medical devices, e.g., blood bags, hemodialysis tubing, and nasogastric feeding tubes, increase body burden levels. We investigated the effects of chronic exposures to low environmentally relevant DEHP levels on testicular function. Our data show that prolonged exposures to this agent induced high levels of the gonadotropin luteinizing hormone and increased the serum concentrations of sex hormones [testosterone and 17beta-estradiol (E2)] by >50%. Increased proliferative activity in Leydig cells was evidenced by enhanced expression of cell cycle proteins, as determined by RT-PCR. The numbers of Leydig cells in the testis of DEHP-treated rats were 40-60% higher than in control rats, indicating induction of Leydig cell hyperplasia. DEHP-induced elevations in serum testosterone and E2 levels suggest the possibility of multiple crosstalks between androgen, estrogen, and steroid hormone receptors, whereas the presence of estrogen receptors in nonreproductive tissues, e.g., cardiovascular system and bones, implies that the increases in serum E2 levels have implications beyond reproduction, including systemic physiology. Analysis of the effects of phthalate exposures on gonadotropin and steroid hormone levels should form part of overall risk assessment in human populations.",
        "The development of synthetic biodegradable polymers, such as poly(alpha-hydroxy acid), is particularly important for constructing medical devices, including scaffolds and sutures, and has attracted growing interest in the biomedical field. Here, we report a novel approach to preparing high molecular weight poly(malic acid) (HMW--PMA) as a biodegradable and bioabsorbable water-soluble polymer. We investigated in detail the reaction conditions for the simple direct polycondensation of l-malic acid, including the reaction times, temperatures, and catalysts. The molecular weight of synthesized alpha,beta-PMA is dependent on both the reaction temperature and time. The optimum reaction condition to obtain alpha,beta-PMA by direct polycondensation using tin(II) chloride as a catalyst was thus determined to be 110 degrees C for 45 h with a molecular weight of 5300. The method for alpha,beta-PMA synthesis established here will facilitate production of alpha,beta-PMA of various molecular weights, which may have a potential utility as biomaterials.",
        "Staphylococcus epidermidis represents the most frequent pathogen involved in nosocomial infections and infections of indwelling medical devices. The strain-to-strain variation of the gene encoding the quorum-sensing pheromone of S. epidermidis as well as the correlation between specificity groups and origin from infection were determined. The pro-pheromone gene was highly conserved and showed infrequent, non-synonymous, single-nucleotide polymorphisms that led to conservative amino acid exchanges only. Importantly, one specificity group was significantly more frequent among strains isolated from infection. The finding that quorum-sensing specificity groups are linked to infection demonstrates the relevance of quorum-sensing for virulence in this critical human pathogen and contributes to the scientific basis needed for the development of quorum-sensing-targeting drugs.",

        "The current focus of medicine on molecular genetics ignores the physical basis of disease even though many of the problems that lead to pain and morbidity, and bring patients to the doctor's office, result from changes in tissue structure or mechanics. The main goal of this article is therefore to help integrate mechanics into our understanding of the molecular basis of disease. This article first reviews the key roles that physical forces, extracellular matrix and cell structure play in the control of normal development, as well as in the maintenance of tissue form and function. Recent insights into cellular mechanotransduction--the molecular mechanism by which cells sense and respond to mechanical stress--also are described. Re-evaluation of human pathophysiology in this context reveals that a wide range of diseases included within virtually all fields of medicine and surgery share a common feature: their etiology or clinical presentation results from abnormal mechanotransduction. This process may be altered by changes in cell mechanics, variations in extracellular matrix structure, or by deregulation of the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense mechanical signals and convert them into a chemical or electrical response. Molecules that mediate mechanotransduction, including extracellular matrix molecules, transmembrane integrin receptors, cytoskeletal structures and associated signal transduction components, may therefore represent targets for therapeutic intervention in a variety of diseases. Insights into the mechanical basis of tissue regulation also may lead to development of improved medical devices, engineered tissues, and biologically-inspired materials for tissue repair and reconstruction.",

        "Manufacturers of medical devices are held to a higher standard than manufacturers of many other products due to the potential severity of the consequences of introducing inferior or unsafe products to the market-place. In Canada, the medical device industry is regulated by Health Canada under the Medical Device Regulations of the Food and Drug Act. The Medical Device Regulations define requirements of medical device design, development and manufacture to ensure that products reaching the public are safe and effective. Health Canada also requires that medical device manufacturers maintain distribution records to ensure that devices can be traced to the source and consumers can be contacted successfully in the event that a device is recalled. Medical devices exported from Canada must be compliant with the regulations of the country of import. The Canadian Medical Device Regulations were based on the Medical Device Directives of the European Union thus facilitating approval of Canadian devices for the European market. The United States Food and Drug Administration has separate and distinct requirements for safety and quality of medical devices. While effort has been made to facilitate approval and trade of Canadian medical devices in the United States and the European Union, obtaining approval from multiple regulatory bodies can result in increased device development time and cost. The Global Harmonization Task Force is an organization composed of members from Japanese, Australian, European, Canadian and American medical device regulatory bodies. This organization was formed with the objective of harmonizing medical device regulations in an effort to facilitate international trade and standardize the quality of medical devices available to all countries.

        "This article puts forward a new proposal to calculate count, turnaround, response, and service time of work orders in a clinical engineering (CE) department. These are calculated by means of a queuing model as a measurement tool. This proposal was tested in a 600-bed hospital with an inventory of 1094 medical devices and with 6 full-time clinical engineers. In April 1999, a simulation (with ARENA 3.01 developed by System Modeling Corporation) of the working of this proposal was performed with desired values being applied to the queuing model. At the end of 2002, real work order data from the database was recorded. As predicted, the results showed that all the indicators of nonscheduled work orders decreased. Response and turnaround time were reduced from 27 to 0.56 hours and 27.48 to 1.13 hours, respectively. From a backlog of 22 outstanding repair orders per month between April 1999 and January 2000, the number was reduced to 4 in December 2002. The queuing model also helped to measure the positive effects on arrival and service rates when users and CE were trained. The difference between simulated and real values was under 5%.",
        "The VitalPoll Telemedicine System (VTS) was designed and developed for wireless home healthcare. The aims of this study were: to design the architecture and communication methods for a telemedicine system; to implement a physiologic routing hub to collect data from different medical devices and sensors; and to evaluate the feasibility of this system for applications in wireless home healthcare. The VTS was built using Bluetooth wireless and Internet technologies with client/server architecture. Several medical devices, which acquire vital signs, such as real-time electrocardiogram signals, heart rate, body temperature, and activity (physical motion), were integrated into the VTS. Medical information and data were transmitted over short-range interface (USB, RS232), wireless communication, and the Internet. The medical results were stored in a database and presented using a web browser. The patient's vital signals can be collected, transmitted, and displayed in real time by the VTS. The experiments verified no data loss during Bluetooth and Internet communication. Bluetooth and the Internet provide enough bandwidth channels to tranmit these vital signs. The experimental results show that VTS may be suitable for a practical telemedicine system in home healthcare.",
        "A comprehensive analytical review of the risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication approaches currently being undertaken by key national, provincial/state, territorial, and international agencies was conducted. The information acquired for review was used to identify the differences, commonalities, strengths, and weaknesses among the various approaches, and to identify elements that should be included in an effective, current, and comprehensive approach applicable to environmental, human health and occupational health risks. More than 80 agencies, organizations, and advisory councils, encompassing more than 100 risk documents, were examined during the period from February 2000 until November 2002. An overview was made of the most important general frameworks for risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication for human health and ecological risk, and for occupational health risk. In addition, frameworks for specific applications were reviewed and summarized, including those for (1)contaminated sites; (2) northern contaminants; (3) priority substances; (4) standards development; (5) food safety; (6) medical devices; (7) prescription drug use; (8) emergency response; (9) transportation; (10) risk communication. Twelve frameworks were selected for more extensive review on the basis of representation of the areas of human health, ecological, and occupational health risk; relevance to Canadian risk management needs; representation of comprehensive and well-defined approaches; generalizability with their risk areas; representation of \"state of the art\" in Canada, the United States, and/or internationally; and extent of usage of potential usage within Canada. These 12 frameworks were: 1. Framework for Environmental Health Risk Management (US Presidential/Congressional Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management, 1997). 2. Health Risk Determination: The Challenge of Health Protection (Health and Welfare Canada, 1990). 3. Health Canada Decision-Making Framework for Identifying, Assessing and Managing Health Risks (Health Canada, 2000). 4. Canadian Environmental Protection Act: Human Health Risk Assessment of Priority Substances(Health Canada, 1994). 5. CSA-Q8550 Risk Management: Guidelines for Decision-Makers (Canada Standards Association, 1997). 6. Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process (US National Research Council, 1983). 7. Understanding Risk: Informing Decisions in a Democratic Society (US National Research Council, 1996). 8. Environmental Health Risk Assessment (enHealth Council of Australia, 2002). 9. A Framework for Ecological Risk Assessment (CCME, 1996). 10. Ecological Risk Assessments of Priority Substances Under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (Environment Canada, 1996).11. Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment (US EPA, 1998b). 12. Proposed Model for Occupational Health Risk Assessment and Management (Rampal & Sadhra, 1999). Based on the extensive review of these frameworks, seven key elements that should be included in a comprehensive framework for human health, ecological, and occupational risk assessment and management were identified: 1. Problem formulation stage. 2. Stakeholder involvement. 3. Communication. 4. Quantitative risk assessment components. 5. Iteration and evaluation. 6. Informed decision making. 7. Flexibility. On the basis of this overarching approach to risk management, the following \"checklist\" to ensure a good risk management decision is proposed: - Make sure you're solving the right problem. - Consider the problem and the risk within the full context of the situation, using a broad perspective. - Acknowledge, incorporate, and balance the multiple dimensions of risk. - Ensure the highest degree of reliability for all components of the risk management process. - Involve interested and effected parties from the outset of the process. - Commit to honest and open communication between all parties. - Employ continuous evaluation throughout the process (formative, process, and outcome evaluation), and be prepared to change the decision if new information becomes available. Comprehensive and sound principles are critical to providing structure and integrity to risk management frameworks. Guiding principles are intended to provide an ethical grounding for considering the many factors involved in risk management decision making. Ten principles are proposed to guide risk management decision making. The first four principles were adapted and modified from Hattis (1996) along with the addition of two more principles by Hrudey (2000). These have been supplemented by another four principles to make the 10 presented. The principles are based in fundamental ethical principles and values. These principles are intended to be aspirational rather than prescriptive--their application requires flexibility and practical judgement. Risk management is inherently a process in search of balance among competing interests and concerns. Each risk management decision will be \"balancing act\" of competing priorities, and trade-offs may sometimes have to be made between seemingly conflicting principles. The 10 decision-making principles, with the corresponding ethical principle in italics are: 1. Do more good than harm (beneficence, nonmalificence).- The ultimate goal of good risk management is to prevent or minimize risk, or to \"do good\" as much as possible. 2. Fair process of decision making (fairness, natural justice). - Risk management must be just, equitable, impartial, unbiased, dispassionate, and objective as far as possible given the circumstances of each situation. 3. Ensure an equitable distribution of risk (equity). - An equitable process of risk management would ensure fair outcomes and equal treatment of all concerned through an equal distribution of benefits and burdens (includes the concept of distributive justice, i.e., equal opportunities for all individuals). 4. Seek optimal use of limited risk management resources (utility). - Optimal risk management demands using limited resources where they will achieve the most risk reduction of overall benefit. 5. Promise no more risk management that can be delivered (honesty).- Unrealistic expectations of risk management can be avoided with honest and candid public accounting of what we know and don't know, and what we can and can't do using risk assessment and risk management. 6. Impose no more risk that you would tolerate yourself (the Golden Rule). - The Golden Rule is important in risk management because it forces decision makers to abandon complete detachment from their decisions so they may understand the perspectives of those affected. 7. Be cautious in the face of uncertainty (\"better safe than sorry\"). - Risk management must adopt a cautious approach when faced with a potentially serous risk, even if the evidence is uncertain. 8. Foster informed risk decision making for all stakeholders (autonomy). - Fostering autonomous decision making involves both providing people with the opportunity to participate, and full and honest disclosure of all the information required for informed decisions. 9. Risk management processes must be flexible and evolutionary to be open to new knowledge and understanding (evolution, evaluation, iterative process). - The incorporation of new evidence requires that risk management be a flexible, evolutionary, and iterative process, and that evaluation is employed at the beginning and througthout the process. 10. the complete elimination fo risk is not possible (life is not risk free).- Risk is pervasive in our society, and cannot be totally eliminated despite an oft-expressed public desire for \"zero risk\". However, the level of risk that may ve tolerable by any individual is dependent on values of beliefs, as well as scientific information. Each agency must continue to employ a process that meets the needs of their specific application of risk management. A single approach cannot satisfy the diverse areas to which risk decisions are being applied. However, with increasing experience in the application of the approaches, we are evolving to a common understanding of the essential elements and principles required for successful risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication. Risk management will continue to be a balancing act of competing priorities and needs. Flexibility and good judgement are ultimately the key to successfully making appropriate risk decisions.",
        "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) has been thought to be progressive and irreversible. Recently, symptomatic reversal of DPN was reported after treatments with a near-infrared medical device, the Anodyne Therapy System (ATS). However, the study was not controlled nor was the investigator blinded. We initiated this study to determine whether treatments with the ATS would decrease pain and/or improve sensation diminished due to DPN under a sham-controlled, double-blind protocol.\nTests involved the use of the 5.07 and 6.65 Semmes Weinstein monofilament (SWM) and a modified Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI). Twenty-seven patients, nine of whom were insensitive to the 6.65 SWM and 18 who were sensitive to this filament but insensitive to the 5.07 SWM, were studied. Each lower extremity was treated for 2 weeks with sham or active ATS, and then both received active treatments for an additional 2 weeks.\nThe group of 18 patients who could sense the 6.65 SWM but were insensitive to the 5.07 SWM at baseline obtained a significant decrease in the number of sites insensate after both 6 and 12 active treatments (P < 0.02 and 0.001). Sham treatments did not improve sensitivity to the SWM, but subsequent active treatments did (P < 0.002). The MNSI measures of neuropathic symptoms decreased significantly (from 4.7 to 3.1; P < 0.001). Pain reported on the 10-point visual analog scale decreased progressively from 4.2 at entry to 3.2 after 6 treatments and to 2.3 after 12 treatments (both P < 0.03). At entry, 90% of subjects reported substantial balance impairment; after treatment, this decreased to 17%. However, among the group of nine patients with greater sensory impairment measured by insensitivity to the 6.65 SWM at baseline, improvements in sensation, neuropathic symptoms, and pain reduction were not significant.\nATS treatments improve sensation in the feet of subjects with DPN, improve balance, and reduce pain.",

In addition, this organism is often isolated from biofilms on the surfaces of various indwelling medical devices. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating biofilm formation in these clinical isolates are largely unknown. Recent work has suggested that a specific cell surface protein (Esp) of E. faecalis is critical for biofilm formation by this organism. However, in the same study, esp-deficient strains of E. faecalis were found to be capable of biofilm formation. To test the hypothesis that Esp is dispensable for biofilm formation by E. faecalis, we used microtiter plate assays and a chemostat-based biofilm fermentor assay to examine biofilm formation by genetically well-defined, non-Esp-expressing strains. Our results demonstrate that in vitro biofilm formation occurs, not only in the absence of esp, but also in the absence of the entire pathogenicity island that harbors the esp coding sequence. Using scanning electron microscopy to evaluate biofilms of E. faecalis OG1RF grown in the fermentor system, biofilm development was observed to progress through multiple stages, including attachment of individual cells to the substratum, microcolony formation, and maturation into complex multilayered structures apparently containing water channels. Microtiter plate biofilm analyses indicated that biofilm formation or maintenance was modulated by environmental conditions. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that expression of a secreted metalloprotease, GelE, enhances biofilm formation by E. faecalis. In summary, E. faecalis forms complex biofilms by a process that is sensitive to environmental conditions and does not require the Esp surface protein.",
        "Pulmonary artery (PA) rupture is a rare but often fatal complication of PA catheterization.\nAn analysis was performed of all the case reports of PA rupture after PA catheterization that were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration's Medical Device Reporting (MDR) system between the years 1991 and 2001. The MDR system is a national passive surveillance system that includes adverse event reports from such sources as manufacturers and healthcare professionals. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a massive, nationally representative database maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, was examined to study patterns of PA catheter use.\nA total of 71 PA rupture cases were identified from the MDR data. The most likely outcome following PA rupture was death. These PA ruptures were associated with 47 deaths and 24 injuries. The range of reported ages of the cases was between 40 and 91 years, with a mean age of 74 years. Of the 71 PA rupture cases, 52 were in women and 10 were in men, with gender not reported in 9 of the cases. There were significantly more cases in women than expected (Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratio estimate = 5.84, 95% confidence interval = 2.97 - 11.46, p < 0.001).\nThese data suggest that women may be at significantly greater risk of PA rupture after PA catheterization than men. Clinicians must be aware of the potential for this complication of PA catheterization.",
        "Tissue engineering is a young and interdisciplinary scientific discipline but it offers exciting opportunities to improve the quality of health care for hundreds of thousands of patients. Lured by its potential, several start-up companies, pharmaceutical corporations, and medical device enterprises alike are investing heavily in this sector. Invention is a key driver of competition in this sector. In this study, we aim to explain the variation in inventive output across the different firms in the sector. Our major premise is that firms that forge alliances will be able to tap into the expertise of their partners and thus improve their chances of inventive output. We further argue that alliances that enable technology acquisition or learning will enhance the inventive output of firms more than other kinds of alliances. We measure the inventive output of a company by the number of patents filed. On the basis of a preliminary analysis of seven companies, we find support for the hypotheses. We also argue that, to achieve commercial success, firms need to manage time to market (through alliances or otherwise), have a global outlook, nurture their financial resources, and attain critical mass through mergers.",
        "Candida albicans adhesion to host tissues contributes to its virulence and adhesion to medical devices permits biofilm formation, but we know relatively little about the molecular mechanisms governing C. albicans adhesion to materials or mammalian cells. Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides an attractive model system for studying adhesion in yeast because of its well-characterized genetics and gene expression systems and the conservation of signal transduction pathways among the yeasts. In this study, we used a parallel plate flow chamber to screen and characterize attachment of a flo8Delta S. cerevisiae strain expressing a C. albicans genomic library to a polystyrene surface. The gene EAP1 was isolated as a putative cell wall adhesin. Sequence analysis of EAP1 shows that it contains a signal peptide, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor site, and possesses homology to many other yeast genes encoding cell wall proteins. In addition to increasing adhesion to polystyrene, heterologous expression of EAP1 in S. cerevisiae and autonomous expression of EAP1 in a C. albicans efg1 homozygous null mutant significantly enhanced attachment to HEK293 kidney epithelial cells. EAP1 expression also restored invasive growth to haploid flo8Delta and flo11Delta strains as well as filamentous growth to diploid flo8/flo8 and flo11/flo11 strains. Transcription of EAP1 in C. albicans is regulated by the transcription factor Efg1p, suggesting that EAP1 expression is activated by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase pathway.",

        "Acinetobacter baumannii causes severe infections in compromised patients, survives on abiotic surfaces in hospital environments and colonizes different medical devices. In this study the analysis of the processes involved in surface attachment and biofilm formation by the prototype strain 19606 was initiated. This strain attaches to and forms biofilm structures on plastic and glass surfaces, particularly at the liquid-air interface of cultures incubated stagnantly. The cell aggregates, which contain cell stacks separated by water channels, formed under different culture conditions and were significantly enhanced under iron limitation. Electron and fluorescence microscopy showed that pili and exopolysaccharides are part of the cell aggregates formed by this strain. Electron microscopy of two insertion derivatives deficient in attachment and biofilm formation revealed the disappearance of pili-like structures and DNA sequencing analysis showed that the transposon insertions interrupted genes with the highest similarity to hypothetical genes found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Although the products of these genes, which have been named csuC and csuE, have no known functions, they are located within a polycistronic operon that includes four other genes, two of which encode proteins related to chaperones and ushers involved in pili assembly in other bacteria. Introduction of a copy of the csuE parental gene restored the adherence phenotype and the presence of pili on the cell surface of the csuE mutant, but not that of the csuC derivative. These results demonstrate that the expression of a chaperone-usher secretion system, some of whose components appear to be acquired from unrelated sources, is required for pili formation and the concomitant attachment to plastic surfaces and the ensuing formation of biofilms by A. baumannii cells.",
        "In this study, 3 types of plasma techniques, i.e. plasma modification, plasma deposition and plasma followed by grafting reaction, are used for the fabrication of tools, medical devices and biomaterials. Depending on purpose, bioadhesion of cells and biomolecules is either looked for or avoided. Since the mechanisms of bioadhesion depend on the characteristics of the surface (hydrophilic or hydrophobic), modifying the surface by a treatment will alter the bioadhesion. These treatments are developed for the anti-fouling process, the sterilisation and the improvement of the formation of biofilms. They have also proved useful for the synthesis of biomimicking devices.",
        "Bioartificial pancreas, in which the islets of Langerhans (islets) are enclosed in an artificial membrane to be protected from the host immune system, is expected to be a promising medical device to treat patients who suffer from insulin-dependent diabetes. Our strategy for preparation of a bioartificial pancreas involves utilizing a membrane including polymeric materials that can inhibit the complement. In our series of studies, we have examined interactions of various polyanions with the complement system to search for potential complement inhibitors. In this study, we concentrated our efforts to clarify the effects of dextran sulfate on the complement system. All of the dextran sulfates examined inhibited the complement activation through both classical and alternative pathways as previously reported. In addition to their inhibitory effects, a certain species of dextran sulfate (molecular mass 10 kDa, degree of sulfonation in a pyranose ring 1.99) specifically degraded C3 without complement activation and, thus, anaphylatoxins that trigger inflammatory reactions were not generated. These facts suggest that a membrane including dextran sulfate effectively protects the islet cells from humoral immunity in addition to not triggering inflammatory reactions. These properties of the membrane make it suitable for a bioratificial pancreas.",
        "The UK and USA are currently undergoing a period of considerable change in their attitude towards medical error and their understanding of its causes and magnitude. In both countries, with increasing rapidity, a disturbing situation is being revealed. This paper presents the results of an investigation into medical errors in the UK and the USA, and focuses in particular on the magnitude and causes of errors when using medical devices. Contrary to the traditional approach of blaming users, it is suggested here that many such errors are caused partly by poor device design, which fails to account adequately for the needs of users. In response, this paper also discusses the basics of a Human Factors Engineering (HFE) approach as a step towards overcoming this problem and offers a challenge to device users and design companies (manufacturers) to follow HFE principles in order to improve the efficiency of operation and reduce errors during device use.",

        "Based on the European Standard EN 1040, the validation guidelines of the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices and CPMP guidelines we tested the antimicrobial effectiveness of a peracetic acid-ethanol sterilization procedure (PES) in allogenic avital bone transplants.\nDelipidated human bone spongiosa cubes (15 x 15 x 15 mm) served as tissue. Three enveloped viruses (human immunodeficiency virus type 2, pseudorabies virus, bovine virus diarrhoea virus) and three non-enveloped viruses (hepatitis A virus, poliovirus, porcine parvovirus) were used. The reduction of virus infectivity was measured as TCID50/ml in neutralized supernatants and bone homogenates. Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacillus subtilis. Clostridium sporogenes, Mycobacterium terrae. Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger as well as spores of Bacillus subtilis were tested additionally. PES led to a reduction of virus titres by more than 4 log10. Only HAV showed a reduction below 4 log10 (2.87) with residual infectivity. After including a delipidating step for HAV-infected cells, a reduction of over 7 log10 HAV titre was found. For viable bacteria, fungi and spores a titre reduction below the detection level (5 log10) was achieved after an incubation time of 2 hours.\nThe peracetic acid-ethanol procedure proved to be a reliable method for the sterilization of human bone transplants (layer thickness < or = 15 mm). However, additional safety measures (anamnestic informations, infectious serology, HIV-/HBV-/HCV-PCR in case of multiorgan donors) should be taken.",

        "Adopting a human factors engineering approach to patient safety requires a radical behavioral shift from \"blame and shame,\" which emphasizes further training, to systems thinking, which also emphasizes improved system design. A medical device manufacturer appeared to initiate this radical shift after exhibiting the traditional approach for years.\nThe research focused on a patient-controlled analgesia device. A qualitative case study methodology was used to study events in the period from the device's introduction (1988) until the start of the behavioral change (May 2001). Data on 50 relevant events were analyzed. The tabular summary was analyzed for evidence of the prerequisites predicted by punctuated equilibrium theory, and the graphical time line was analyzed for evidence of vertical alignment across levels.\nRadical behavioral change was preceded by a critical 9.5-month period with three characteristics: new corporate leadership, perceived poor corporate performance, and aligned disruptions occurring within a relatively short time at almost every level in the external environment in which the company operated.\nThese findings are consistent with punctuated equilibrium theory, according to which organizations can experience long periods of resistance to change followed by fast revolutionary change (approximately two years). The findings also have implications for when and how to introduce patient safety policy interventions to \"tilt the playing field\" and thereby increase the likelihood that such reforms will succeed.",
        "The flow and concentration fields for various medical oxygen delivery devices are numerically investigated. Simulations are performed for a classical Venturi mask and two new OxyArm portable devices. The velocity and oxygen concentration fields are investigated for: (i) a constant (steady-state) inhalation and (ii) a complete respiratory cycle (unsteady). The numerical results are qualitatively compared with clinical trials. It is found that the optimal functioning of these medical devices implies a balance between oxygen delivery by advection and the mixing process that allows for reliable CO2 monitoring (capnographic capability). Also, at the typical scales associated with these devices the flow is found to be Reynolds number dependent.",
        "This comparative exercise analysed the domestic market for stoma appliances in five European countries--Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. National legislation, prescription procedures, delivery modalities and the market were investigated in each country. The analysis involved reviewing national and international literature on stoma appliances and interviewing a selected expert panel of market operators in each country comprising at least one health authority representative, one distributor of medical devices and one manufacturer. No specific relationship was found between the health care system framework and the stoma market, except for a greater inclination towards home care in national health services. All five countries reimburse stoma bags, but the distribution of these appliances varies widely, ranging from Denmark, where home delivery is mandatory, to Italy, where any channel can be used. The comparative analysis underlined two important features of the stoma bag market: the discretion of enterostomists in directing patients towards a specific brand of bags, and the patients' high brand loyalty. Despite that, the analysis did not identify any single country that could be considered a benchmark for stoma bag regulation. Each country deals with stoma appliances in different ways, making this a very fragmented market.",
        "To develop new biomaterials for making medical devices, polymer alloys composed of a phospholipid polymer, poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC), and polyethylene (PE) were prepared. The PE/PMPC alloy membrane could be obtained by a combination of solution mixing and solvent evaporation methods using xylene and n-butanol mixture as a solvent. Moreover, thermal treatment was applied to improve the mechanical properties of the PE/PMPC alloy membrane. In the PE/PMPC alloy membrane, the PMPC domains were located not only inside the membrane but also at the surface. Surface analysis of the PE/PMPC alloy membrane with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, wettability evaluation, and dynamic contact angle measurements revealed that the phospholipid polar groups in the PMPC covered the surface even after thermal treatment. Blood compatibility tests with attention to platelet adhesion and change in morphology of adhered platelets showed that the PE/PMPC alloy membrane had excellent platelet adhesion resistance. We finally concluded that the PE/PMPC alloy could be used as biomaterials instead of poly(vinyl chloride)-based materials.",
        "Stainless steel treated with a mixed gas plasma of NH(3) plus O(2) had chemical and biologic characteristics distinct from untreated stainless steel or stainless steel treated with NH(3) or O(2) plasmas used separately. NH(3)/O(2) plasmas deposited nitrogen as both -CN (organic) and -NO (nitrate, nitrite)--materials not found on untreated stainless steel--and the contact angle changed from 44 degrees to 23 degrees. Treatment of stainless steel (and titanium) resulted in surfaces with enhanced resistance to platelet and leukocyte attachment. A gas plasma of N(2)O/O(2) also was found to reduce platelet and leukocyte attachment, suggesting that these properties may be common to surfaces coated with oxynitrites (nitrides). Upon subcutaneous implantation, no inflammation, hemolysis, or untoward thrombosis was noted in the tissue surrounding the wafers treated with the NH(3)/O(2) plasmas, although the cellular density was considerably reduced by 2 weeks after implant. Collectively, the results suggest that NH(3)/O(2) plasmas impart a unique character to stainless steel that may be useful in the construction of medical devices.",
        "Aquamid represents a new generation of soft-tissue fillers thanks to the lack of particles and a very high concentration of water. Aquamid is the result of a new, patented production method called \"In line Cross-Linking Technology\" (ILX Technology). The Aquamid gel contains 2.5% polyacrylamide (PAAG) and 97.5% water. It is homogenous, perfectly stable and nonbiodegradable and has optimum viscosity and elasticity. Aquamid has been authorized for sale in Europe since March 2001 as a new medical device (CE-mark 0543). This pilot study presents our experiences with Aquamid based on 59 subjects treated with 77 doses mainly used for aesthetic correction but even on medical indication. Lip augmentation was the most frequent procedure (72%), dominated by the age groups from 20 to 25 and from 50 to 60 years. Cheekbone enlargement was carried out in 13% of the cases. The rest concerned augmentation of deep naso-labial fold, glabella, and chin with 5% representation of each. The patient satisfaction was almost 100% with the aesthetic results and either short time or long time side effect reported during a follow-up period of 9 months (range: 2 to 16 months). Aquamid is easy to use without any pretest. Considering its long-lasting effect and the need for sterile conditions with use, only qualified and experienced staff, preferably physicians, should administrate the gel. Adequate indication, correct handling, and thoughtful following of the recommendations/cautions are of vital importance. Given that, aquamid seems to be a promising long-lasting soft tissue filler.",
        "The quality of the notifications issued within the European Medical Device Vigilance system were retrospectively reviewed and the adequacy of the recommended guidelines evaluated. The study material comprised all 589 vigilance notifications the Finnish competent authority received from manufacturers and other national competent authorities during 1997, 1999, and 2001. The number of vigilance reports, particularly the reports issued by national competent authorities, has increased from 82 in 1997 up 166 in 2001 while the proportion of reports with demonstrated bearing on health risk has decreased from about 40% down to 20% during the last five years. The number of manufacturers' reports has also increased from 28 in 1997 up to 98 in 2001 while the information given in the reports have become somewhat more incoherent. The time needed to close a device-related incident has increased, too. It is obvious that the present vigilance guidelines provide adequate guidance for both the manufacturers and competent authorities to manage vigilance cases efficiently and appropriately. It is crucial that all pertinent parties should adopt the recommended procedures and act accordingly. The vigilance system underpinned with high quality notifications only assures the continuous enhancement of patient safety, the bottom line.",
        "In this paper, the authors propose a novel electric power supply system for implanted medical devices. The system is noninvasive and uses two kinds of energy, magnetic and ultrasonic. The system can provide high power levels harmlessly. The energies are obtained by two types of vibrator, i.e., piezo and magnetostriction devices. A prototype was built and it was verified experimentally that the system is basically able to provide power. At high frequencies, such as 100 kHz, the output power was higher than the conventional system using a transformer. The normalized output power per unit volume also exceeded the transformer system.",

The outer diameter was 330 microm with a wall thickness of 70 microm. Transfer rates of O2 and CO2 in the asymmetric polyimide fiber were 6.9 x 10(-3) and 5.5 x 10(-3) cm3 (STP)/(cm2 s cmHg), respectively, which are approximately 10 times higher than those measured in the Menox and Si-polypropylene fibers of the presently available membrane oxygenators. The blood compatibility of the polyimide hollow fiber was evaluated in vivo, indicating that polyimide had excellent blood compatibility when compared with silicone-coated fiber. Additionally, we fabricated a novel porous membrane with three-dimensional fine structure from cylindrical microscale pores and examined possibility of a porous membrane for use in hemodialysis.",

        "Chronic leg ulceration costs the NHS around pound 500 million per year (Moffatt and Dorman, 1995) so it is not surprising that the condition attracts attention from manufacturers of medical devices. However, the evidence available for many novel technologies is scant and a systematic approach to product evaluation is essential to avoid the adoption of ineffective and therefore costly measures. A low-frequency ultrasound device was presented in clinic as an aid to stimulate and accelerate healing in otherwise recalcitrant wounds. There followed a systematic evaluation of the product including a literature review of the mode of action, safety and efficacy, followed finally by a product evaluation with case studies used as outcome measures. In this case, the product proved to be a useful tool in the management of chronic wounds, not only for healing but also for pain, pigmentation and odour reduction. The importance of understanding fully a novel technology and how it fits with clinical practice cannot be underestimated.",

        "Heart failure (HF) is a significant clinical and economic burden in the industrialized world. Advances in pharmaceutical compounds and various medical device technologies along with the use of sophisticated HF clinics have enhanced HF treatment and improved morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. However, hospital readmission rates remain stubbornly high. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels provide valuable information about a patient's chance of readmission within 30 days of discharge, making BNP a potentially useful tool for making discharge decisions and possibly reducing readmissions.\nThis review examines the strength and level of evidence in key areas to determine if BNP levels could be used as a guide for discharge of HF patients. Although most of the literature describes nonrandomized studies, there is general agreement that BNP levels can be measured accurately and precisely, that BNP levels reflect varying physiologic states, and that they predict outcomes.\nMore studies are needed to determine extent of biologic variability. The further use of BNP as a potential discharge marker is promising but awaits additional randomized study that reflects use in a broad-based population.",

        "The Directive on in vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (IVDD 98/79/EC) was officially adopted by the European Union (EU) on December 7, 1998. The IVDD aims to supplement the legal framework of the European Community, which governs the conditions for the placing on the market of medical devices, by extending the already implemented legislation to the category of in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs). They consist of those devices, including reagents and reagent products, calibrator materials or instruments, as well as specimen receptacles, intended by the manufacturer for the in vitro analysis of specimens derived from the human body. This directive has introduced at the European level common regulatory requirements across Europe for the safety, quality and performance of in vitro diagnostics (IVDs), incorporating them into medical device legislation. It harmonizes the conformity assessment procedures to be applied by manufacturers before they place IVDs on the market. For certain products expressly specified in the directive, of which the most important are used for the evaluation of the safety of blood supply and patient testing, the manufacturer will have to take into account in their performance evaluation the so-called \"Common Technical Specifications\" (CTS). These are needed to establish the performance characteristics of the IVDs in evaluation and have the same status as harmonized standards. In the meantime, the IVD directive has been transposed into national law in all EU countries. During a transitional period ending in December 2003, manufacturers will have the option of following pre-existing national regulatory processes or taking their IVDs through the new procedures as specified in the directive. Following this, starting from 7th December 2003, adherence to the directive regulations will become mandatory, and only IVDs bearing the \"Communaut\u00e9s Europ\u00e9ennes (CE) mark\" can then be sold in the EU.",
        "Regarded as normal flora of the human skin and mucus membranes, non-diphtheria corynebacteria are frequently dismissed as contaminants or harmless colonizers. Recently, the pathogenic potential of C. striatum has been realized in immunocompromised patients with indwelling medical devices and previous antibiotic exposure.\nWe report here the diagnosis, treatment and clinical outcome of a peritoneal dialysis patient with a C. striatum infection of the catheter exit site. The aim is to present important features to assist in identifying clinically significant infections and provide guidelines for treatment.\nAn immunocompromised patient with previous antimicrobial exposure developed an acute dialysis catheter exit site infection. C. striatum was isolated in pure growth. After initial treatment failure with oral antibiotics and intensified wound care, a satisfactory outcome was ultimately achieved without relapse or loss of the catheter with a 1-month course of vancomycin, 1 g intravenously, administered at 5-day intervals.\nThe virulent capacity of Corynebacterium species should not be underestimated, particularly in high-risk patients. The presence of clinical signs of infection with isolation of the organism in pure culture and the presence of Gram-positive rods on direct Gram stain, especially in association with a leukocyte reaction, supports a cause and effect relationship. Because corynebacteria may be multiresistant, susceptibility testing should be performed on clinically significant isolates. Initial antibiotic selection is influenced by the severity of the infection, however, current experience favors vancomycin in significant infections.",

        "Acetals remain extremely important for medical devices, particularly in gears, springs and other mechanisms, although going forward with progressively lower emission targets is likely to require a combination of low-emission grades and tighter processing controls. Nylon and PBT materials have a continued importance in achieving the combination of mechanical performance, biocompatibility (a range of grades are available that have been tested successfully against USP 23 Class VI) and sterilisation performance (dependent on grade and type of sterilisation). Materials such as liquid crystal polymer are progressively more important for their barrier properties, high temperature performance and all-round sterilisation performance. Polycarbonates and cyclic olefin copolymers continue to find new applications, often where clarity is important; transparent Nylons and other olefinic materials are also valuable in this area. With the continuing advances in raw materials and polymer processes, careful choices can produce some worthy advances in device technology, although utilising the technologies effectively still depends on working forwards from the user/patient need and desired functionality. Whether considering developing a new device using plastics, or reconsidering further development of an existing device, engineering polymers can provide the key to something better.",
        "Manufacturers of refractive surgical lasers are seeking Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for refractive surgery based on wavefront measurements rather than manifest refractions. This article draws attention to the need for better understanding of the relationship between aberrations and visual function and better testing methods for evaluating safety and effectiveness of wavefront-guided refractive surgery.\nBefore U.S. market approval for a new medical device, the FDA must determine whether the manufacturer has provided reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use, based on valid scientific evidence. The issues discussed here are based on FDA reviewers' experiences in evaluating Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) and Premarket Approval (PMA) applications for wavefront-guided refractive lasers.\nEven an optimal wavefront correction can provide only a marginally greater visual function benefit than a conventional spherocylindrical correction in a normal eye. Actual benefits are even smaller or nonexistent because variability from uncontrollable sources (eg, healing, aging, accommodation, pupil size, or ocular biomechanical effects) are typically larger than the errors treated. The effects of higher order aberrations and aberration changes on visual function are complex and poorly understood.\nThe FDA's need for better tools to assess safety and effectiveness of wavefront-guided refractive surgery has stimulated major research efforts within the vision, ophthalmic, and optometric research communities. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between aberrations and visual function, and to be able to predict the visual effects of specific aberration changes in individual eyes. This research would have been more appropriately done before rather than after clinical trials for wavefront-guided refractive lasers.",

        "The aim of this study is to determine the in vitro activity of allicin against Staphylococcus epidermidis and to evaluate the influence of allicin on biofilm formation.\nIn vitro activity of allicin (diallyl thiosulphinate) against 38 strains of S. epidermidis was investigated. The activity of allicin was similar against S. epidermidis methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant strains [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90=8 mg l(-1)]. In general, subinhibitory concentrations (sub-MIC) of allicin diminished biofilm formation in the five strains analysed.\nThe results confirm the antibacterial effect of allicin. Sub-MICs of allicin also diminished the biofilm formations by S. epidermidis.\nThe present study shows that allicin is active in vitro against S. epidermidis and that sub-MICs of allicin may play a role in the prevention of adherence of this bacteria to medical devices.",
        "In June 2000 the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) issued a Hazard Notice recommending the explantation of Trilucent breast implants (TBP) as a precautionary measure. Following that recommendation, we reviewed our series of 52 patients (71 implants) operated on from 1994 to 1998 to recall and advise those still harboring TBP. We have analyzed all the recorded adverse events in our setting before June 2000 to estimate the adverse reaction frequency and their time relation (review series). We have also recorded the rate of preoperative symptoms and postoperative findings in 23 patients (29 implants) who underwent explantation after the MDA recommendation (explantation series). In addition, some histologic observations have been made. The rates of significant capsular contracture (Baker 3-4) and explantations were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method of survival analysis, and the rates of wrinkling and palpability were compared at 1 and 5 years of follow-up. Overall, the rate of grade 3-4 capsular contracture was approximately 45% at 6 years of follow-up with no statistically significant difference among the reconstruction and augmentation groups. The analysis of survival curves showed an overall rate of approximately 55% of explantations at 6 years. Preoperatively, capsular contracture and volume modifications were the most frequent findings in the explantation series. Postoperatively, most implants opposed inadequate resistance to the operative stress and ruptured, showing a creamy content. Free oil has never been found in tissue surrounding the periprosthetic capsule. In conclusion, it appears that the TBP-claimed advantages over other available implants seem to be inconsistent and the MDA advice appropriate. The problems related to these implants have had a great impact on public opinion in Europe and have contributed to the implementation of the conformity assessment procedures to be followed for medical devices: on the 4th February 2003 breast implants were in fact reclassified as class 3 products, in order to provide the best guarantee for health protection. The publication of a communication by the European Parliament in November 2001 gives us hope for the future.",
        "The advent of simultaneous global clinical trials and drug registration strategies has increased the demand for global pharmacoeconomic strategies. Outcomes researchers in pharmaceutical companies are faced with the challenge of assessing at a strategic level what pharmacoeconomic data are most useful in Japan and when, and then deciding at a tactical level what type of study designs are feasible. This paper is written mainly for the benefit of researchers working outside of Japan in the pharmaceutical/medical device industry or academia who are interested in conducting research in Japan. We reviewed the existing pharmacoeconomic literature in Japan, and found that the number of studies per year has been steadily increasing. The majority of studies have been cost-effectiveness and cost-consequence analyses. Typical data sources available in Japan are somewhat limited compared with other Western countries. However, charge data can be easily accessed through the national uniform reimbursement fee system and these data are particularly relevant for pharmaceutical pricing negotiations with the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW). The present use of pharmacoeconomic data by pharmaceutical companies is mainly for pricing negotiations but recent reforms make certain types of data useful for marketing strategies too. The demand for pharmacoeconomic data may increase because of upcoming MHLW pharmaceutical pricing and/or recent health insurance system reforms. Economic evaluation of medical technologies in Japan, though lagging behind North America, Australia and Europe, has the potential to rapidly gather momentum as increasing cost-escalation worries contribute to a growing interest in pharmacoeconomic data.",

        "The reproducible advantages of minimal invasive surgery have led to a worldwide spread of these techniques. Nevertheless, the increasing use of technology causes problems in the operating room (OR). The workstation environment and workflow are handicapped by a great number of isolated solutions that demand a large amount of space. The Center of Excellence in Medical Technology (CEMET) was established in 2001 as an institution for a close cooperation between users, science, and manufacturers of medical devices in the State of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. The future OR, as a major project, began with a detailed process analysis, which disclosed a large number of medical devices with different interfaces and poor standardisation as main problems. Smaller and more flexible devices are necessary, as well as functional modules located outside the OR. Only actuators should be positioned near the operation area. The future OR should include a flexible-room concept and less equipment than is in use currently. A uniform human-user interface is needed to control the OR environment. This article addresses the need for a clear workspace environment, intelligent-user interfaces, and flexible-room concept to improve the potentials in use of minimal invasive surgery.",
        "Toray Industries Inc. has developed an endotoxin removal cartridge (Toraymyxin) composed of a polymyxin B immobilized, fibrous adsorbent. Toraymyxin has been listed as a blood purification medical device for endotoxin removal to be reimbursed by the Japanese national health insurance since 1994. Toraymyxin can be applied to patients with endotoxemia or suspected gram-negative infection, which fulfilll the conditions of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and have septic shock demanding vasopressor infusion. Since 1994, over 30,000 patients have received this treatment. The safety of this device has been confirmed and improvement of hemodynamic dysfunction has been shown to be a major benefit. Infection resulting from an acute abdominal condition requiring surgery has been shown to be one of the good indications for Toraymyxin. Further studies are now ongoing to establish Toraymyxin treatment as one of the options to treat sepsis and septic shock patients and to clarify the mechanisms involved in this therapy.",
        "Apheresis has been recognized both economically and therapeutically as a novel approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, and certain others, which respond poorly to drug therapy. This report is about Adacolumn, an adsorptive carrier based granulocyte and monocyte apheresis device with a volume of 335 mL, filled with about 220 g of cellulose acetate beads of 2 mm diameter as the column adsorptive carriers. Pre- and post-column leukocyte counts have shown that the carriers adsorb about 65% of granulocytes, 55% of monocytes and 2% of lymphocytes from the blood in the column. Additionally, after apheresis, there is a marked decrease in inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8) produced by blood leukocytes, together with down-modulation of L-selectin and the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Adacolumn has been used to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and HIV infection. Typical apheresis sessions have been 4-10, at a frequency of one or two sessions per week. Treatment of patients with Adacolumn has been associated with very promising efficacy and safety data. Accordingly, in Japan, Adacolumn has been approved by the Ministry of Health for the treatment of ulcerative colitia. Furthermore, Adacolumn met the required quality and safety standards for medical devices and received an EC certification (CE-mark) from TUV in 1999. However, although Adacolumn carriers are very efficient in depleting excess and activated granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages, the clinical efficacy associated with Adacolumn apheresis cannot be fully explained on the basis of reducing granulocytes and monocytes per se. Hence, a long lasting effect on inflammatory cytokine generation, chemokine activities or immunomodulation is likely, but the precise mechanisms involved are not fully understood yet.",

        "This descriptive study investigated the patterns of use of physical restraints in a Korean Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with the aim of identifying the factors that would best discriminate the times of application and removal of restraints in the same patients. The subjects of the study were 23 physically restrained patients out of 51 patients who were admitted to a medical ICU in a university hospital admitted during a 6-week period, and the 29 nurses who applied or removed the restraints. Ninety-four incidents of restraint application and removal on the 23 patients were analysed. Data were collected using a self-reporting questionnaire of attitudes towards restraint application for nurses, restraint document sheets, ICU flowsheets and patient chart reviews. Restraint-related patient data were collected on a restraint document sheet by the nurse in charge at each instance of application and removal of restraint. The most common type of restraint was the bilateral wrist restraint. The mean number of restraint applications per patient was 3.62 +/- 3.56 (mean +/- SD), and the mean restrained period per incident was 22.64 +/- 58 hours. There were no significant differences in the frequency of restraint use during the day, evening and night shifts. The most significant discriminators for restraint application and removal were the restless-behaviour score and the presence of a nasogastric tube - the classification accuracy by these two factors was 70.2%. More than 90% of the decisions to apply restraints were made by nurses. Nurses reported that preventing the patient from removing medical devices (48.6%) was the primary reason for application, and improvement of cognitive status (29.3%) was the primary reason for removal of restraint. In conclusion, as the most discriminating factor of application or removal of restraints was the patient's restless behaviour, providing nurses with tools for the accurate evaluation of patient restlessness will shorten restraint application periods in ICUs.",
        "Since complement activation is recognized as a common response of the host defense system when an artificial medical device is applied to a patient, great effort has been devoted to studies on the interaction of the complement system with artificial materials. However, some uncertainties remain, partially because of the lack of well characterized surfaces and suitable analytic methods for study of the surface phenomena that occur on artificial materials under physiologic conditions. In this study, we employed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique to study interactions of the serum complement with well characterized surfaces. Self-assembled monolayers carrying various concentrations of hydroxyl groups were prepared using 11-mercapto-1-undecanol (C11-OH) and one of n-nonanethiol, n-dodecanethiol, and n-hexadecanethiol. The amount of NHS deposition on the SAMs increased with increasing C11-OH content of the SAMs, and the amount of anti-C3b antibody immobilization formed on the NHS deposition layers increased with increasing C11-OH content of the SAMs. These results clearly demonstrate that a large amount of C3b, produced through the activation of the complement system, binds covalently to and is adsorbed by hydroxyl-group-rich surfaces. The combination of SAMs and the SPR technique is suitable for studying the interaction of the complement system with solid surfaces, and the results should give basic information needed for a rational design of biocompatible surfaces on synthetic materials.",
        "Sulfonated polyrotaxanes (PRx-SO(3)'s), in which sulfonated alpha-cyclodextrins (alpha-CDs) were threaded onto the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) segments in a PEG-b-poly(propylene glycol) (PPG)-b-PEG triblock copolymer (Pluronic) capped with benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)-L-phenylalanine (Z-L-Phe), were prepared as a novel surface-modifying biomaterial. Surface modification of the polyurethane (PU) was carried out by blending the PRx-SO(3)'s with a PU solution, followed by solution casting. The incorporated PRx-SO(3)'s led to the enhanced hydrophilicity by changing the surface properties of the PU matrix. Modified PUs showed the stable entrapment of the PRx-SO(3)'s with little extraction into water and enhanced mechanical properties after exposure to water compared to the PU control. The incorporated PRx-SO(3)'s repelled the proteins and kept them from closely approaching the surface areas, prevented platelet activation by thrombin, and effectively repelled bacteria. These results suggest that both the supramolecular structure of the polyrotaxanes and exposure of the sulfonated groups onto the surfaces contribute to these phenomena. Thus, surface modification with PRx-SO(3)'s is suggested to be useful for the fabrication of biocompatible medical devices.",
        "The patent system has been seen as a critical factor driving innovation in clinical medicine, particularly in medical devices and diagnostic assays. The licence terms and business model proposed by Myriad Genetics Inc. for testing the hereditary breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 could stifle innovation (particularly if other companies adopt similar business models), and are likely to limit the ability to provide high quality public genetic testing services in Australia. Under the Myriad model, testing for the BRCA1 gene would be undertaken by an organisation removed from the integrated public healthcare system. Based on overseas experience, Australia can expect a 2-3-fold increase in the cost of this testing, which will provide only partial information on the hereditary breast cancer status of the patient. Commercial exploitation of gene patents needs to be regulated to balance the patent holders' right to profit from their inventions (necessary to drive further innovation) and the public policy objective of high quality, equitable healthcare.",
        "Porous solids are of great technological importance due to their ability to interact with gases and liquids not only at the surface, but throughout their bulk. Although large pores can be produced and well controlled in a variety of materials, nanopores in the range of 2 nm and below (micropores, according to IUPAC classification) are usually achieved only in carbons or zeolites. To date, major efforts in the field of porous materials have been directed towards control of the size, shape and uniformity of the pores. Here we demonstrate that porosity of carbide-derived carbons (CDCs) can be tuned with sub\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m accuracy in a wide range by controlling the chlorination temperature. CDC produced from Ti3SiC2 has a narrower pore-size distribution than single-wall carbon nanotubes or activated carbons; its pore-size distribution is comparable to that of zeolites. CDCs are produced at temperatures from 200-1,200 degrees C as a powder, a coating, a membrane or parts with near-final shapes, with or without mesopores. They can find applications in molecular sieves, gas storage, catalysts, adsorbents, battery electrodes, supercapacitors, water/air filters and medical devices.",
        "A presumed antimicrobial enzyme system, the Curvularia haloperoxidase system, was examined with the aim of evaluating its potential as a sanitizing agent. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, Curvularia haloperoxidase facilitates the oxidation of halides, such as chloride, bromide, and iodide, to antimicrobial compounds. The Curvularia haloperoxidase system caused several-log-unit reductions in counts of bacteria (Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas salmonicida, Shewanella putrefaciens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes), yeasts (Candida sp. and Rhodotorula sp.), and filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus tubigensis, Aspergillus versicolor, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium chrysogenum, and Penicillium paxilli) cultured in suspension. Also, bacteria adhering to the surfaces of contact lenses were killed. The numbers of S. marcescens and S. epidermidis cells adhering to contact lenses were reduced from 4.0 and 4.9 log CFU to 1.2 and 2.7 log CFU, respectively, after treatment with the Curvularia haloperoxidase system. The killing effect of the Curvularia haloperoxidase system was rapid, and 10(6) CFU of E. coli cells/ml were eliminated within 10 min of treatment. Furthermore, the antimicrobial effect was short lived, causing no antibacterial effect against E. coli 10 min after the system was mixed. Bovine serum albumin (1%) and alginate (1%) inhibited the antimicrobial activity of the Curvularia haloperoxidase system, whereas glucose and Tween 20 did not affect its activity. In conclusion, the Curvularia haloperoxidase system is an effective sanitizing system and has the potential for a vast range of applications, for instance, for disinfection of contact lenses or medical devices.",
        "At a rapid pace, in vitro diagnostic medical devices are being developed to detect risk factors for disease; to a growing extent, these test kits are also directly marketed to the public for use at home. While at first sight serving a good cause, self testing may have considerable drawbacks relating to the well-being of the test subject on the one hand, and to the privacy and the right not to know of other persons on the other. This raises the question whether the availability of self tests should be restricted. Taking into account legal developments in The Netherlands and the European Union, the author argues in favour of restrictions, at least when serious diseases or conditions are concerned. The existence of the internet is not an excuse for not adopting such safeguards.",
        "The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) raises questions about the appropriate infection control measures to use when conducting maintenance procedures on medical devices that may have been exposed to the SARS virus--that is, devices that have been used on, or located in the same room as, a patient with (or suspected to have) SARS. Although there is considerable information and guidance available on many aspects of SARS, very little exists on this particular topic. What's more, we have found significant differences in the perspectives and recommendations of some of the experts on the subject. This article provides guidance for clinical engineering, respiratory therapy, and other personnel involved in maintaining potentially SARS-exposed equipment. To derive our recommendations, we reviewed the material posted on the Web sites of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), along with other information sources; we also discussed issues related to equipment use and servicing with experts outside ECRI.",
        "Bacteria that adhere to implanted medical devices play an important role in industry and in modern medicine. Staphylococci are among the most common pathogens that cause biomaterial infections. Vascular prosthetic graft infection is one of the most feared complications that the vascular surgeon treats, frequently resulting in prolonged hospitalization, organ failure, amputation, and death. A rat model was used to investigate the topical efficacies of temporin A and the quorum-sensing inhibitor RNAIII-inhibiting protein (RIP) as prophylactic agents of vascular prosthetic graft infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis with intermediate resistance to glycopeptides.\nGraft infections were established in the back subcutaneous tissue of adult male Wistar rats by implantation of Dacron prostheses 1 cm2 followed by topical inoculation with 2x10(7) colony-forming units of bacterial strains. The study included, for each staphylococcal strain, a control group (no graft contamination), a contaminated group that did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis, and 6 contaminated groups that received grafts soaked with temporin A, RIP, rifampin, temporin A plus RIP, RIP plus rifampin, or temporin A plus RIP. The infection was evaluated by quantitative agar culture. When tested alone, temporin A and RIP showed comparable efficacies, and their efficacies were significantly higher than that of rifampin against both strains. All combinations showed efficacies significantly higher than that of each single compound. The combinations of temporin A and RIP exerted the strongest antistaphylococcal efficacies, eliminating infection by 100%.\nThe results of the present study make these molecules potentially useful for antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis in vascular surgery.",

        "This study examines the effect of including muscle forces in fatigue tests of cemented total hip arthroplasty reconstructions.\nAn experimental device capable of applying the joint reaction force, the abductor force, the vastus lateralis force, and the tensor fasciae latae force to the implanted femur is described.\nCurrent in vitro fatigue tests of cemented total hip arthroplasty reconstructions do not apply physiological muscle loads. Experimental and numerical studies report significant differences in stresses obtained in the cement mantle depending on the loads applied. The differing stresses may alter the outcome of an in vitro test.\nTen femoral components were reproducibly implanted into proximal composite femurs. Five of these femoral components were tested using a loadprofile which included muscle loading, five were tested without muscle loading. The migration of each femoral component was monitored continuously during dynamic fatigue tests.\nClinically comparable migration amounts were found for both sets of femoral components, with the femoral components tested with muscle loading experiencing lower mean migration, lower mean inducible displacement, and less experimental scatter.\nThe inclusion of muscle forces seems to stabilise the femoral component during the test. In vitro fatigue tests of cemented total hip arthroplasty reconstructions should include muscle loading to provide increased confidence in the results obtained.\nThis study examines how the migration of cemented femoral hip prostheses is influenced by muscle forces. Hip prostheses are one of the few medical devices for which pre-clinical testing protocols have emerged, and this study ascertains whether or not the inclusion of muscle forces is necessary for pre-clinical tests. The conclusion that muscle loading should be included, and that it is important for the development of a new generation of standardised tests to provide enhanced patient protection against functionally poor prostheses.",
        "Inter-subject variability in therapeutic drug response and drug toxicity is a major problem in clinical practice. In this field genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes play an important role. In a multicenter study supported by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM, Z 12.01-68502-201) adverse drug reactions (ADRs) leading to hospital admission to departments of internal medicine have been registered and evaluated. The aim of the presented part of the study was to look for evident differences in genotypes for polymorphic drug metabolizing enzymes between adverse drug reaction cases and controls. All cases found in the local area--Jena and Weimar--were genotyped for N-acetyl-transferase 2 (NAT2), cytochrom P450 (CYP) 2D6 and 2C19 in comparison to a control population of the same region. The investigation on genotype was carried out for about 2 years (2000-2002). 254 blood samples from patients of the ADR study were analyzed. The genotype of drug metabolizing enzymes was determined by means of polymerase chain reaction using allel specific primers or restriction enzyme analysis. Within all ADRs cases genotyped, no exceptional frequencies for slow acetylators or poor metabolizers (PM) of CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 were found. About 65% of the individuals with ADR genotypically displayed a slow acetylator state. 6.3% PM for CYP2D6, including CYP2D6*3, *4 and *6 alleles, and 2.0% PM frequency for CYP2C19 (*2) have been found in ADR cases. A direct connection between PM genotype and the ADR observed may be assumed only in few of them. Further investigations on genotype and ADR-associated drugs require a much larger sample of patients to obtain more data allowing to focus an association on specific drugs, ADR and polymorphisms genotype of drug metabolizing enzymes might be useful.",
        "Gastric neuromuscular disorders encompass a spectrum of dysfunction in nerve and smooth muscle that includes gastric visceral hypersensitivity, gastric dysrhythmias, fundic dysfunction, antral hypomotility, and gastroparesis. Patients with each disorder may present with such vague dyspepsia symptoms as early satiety, upper abdominal discomfort, bloating, or nausea with or without vomiting. A careful history and physical examination may suggest a gastric neuromuscular disorder, but symptoms are nonspecific. Gastroparesis is the most severe form of neuromuscular dysfunction. Such reversible causes of gastroparesis as mechanical obstruction of the stomach and chronic mesenteric ischemia must be excluded. Gastroparesis, gastric dysrhythmias, and hypersensitivity may follow viral infection or be due to degenerative processes that affect the gastric enteric neurons, smooth muscle, or interstitial cells of Cajal. Commonly, the cause of these gastric neuromuscular disorders is unknown. An approach to the diagnosis and treatment of gastric neuromuscular disorders is reviewed, including dietary counseling, drugs, and medical devices.",

        "Ethylene oxide (EO) gas is commonly used to sterilize medical devices. The amount of residual EO remaining in a device depends partly on the type and size of polymeric material. A major concern is the amount of residue that may be available in the body. With the use of the method described by AAMI for headspace analysis of EO residues, different polymers and medical devices subjected to different numbers of sterilization cycles were examined. Next, the effect of various extraction conditions and extraction solutions on these polymers and medical devices was evaluated. The results showed different polymers desorb EO differently. One polyurethane (PU 75D) had much higher EO residue than a different polyurethane (PU 80A). Repeated extraction of the PU 75D was necessary to quantify total EO residue levels. Different extraction solutions influence the amount and reproducibility of EO detected, whereas multiple resterilizations showed no difference in amount of residual EO. Bioavailability of EO was estimated by extracting the devices and polymers in water. Comparison of total EO residues to EO that was bioavailable showed no difference for some polymers and devices, while others had an almost eightfold difference. Some standard biocompatibility tests were run on extracts and devices, but no significant effects were observed.",
        "The choice of intraocular lens (IOL) implanted by cataract surgeons has significant implications for the effectiveness of the operation and the subsequent need for capsulotomy.\nComparison of pertinent peer-reviewed literature published from 1996 through 2001 obtained from a MEDLINE literature search on biocompatibility indicators and IOLs. This review pertains to routine, uncomplicated cataract surgery, and thus, the findings may not be relative to complicated surgeries. Currently available IOLs were not included in this review if no published data on the IOL were available. However, representative lenses from all the major biomaterial classes were included.\nOverall results of a comparison of published accounts of posterior capsular opacification, Nd:YAG capsulotomies, anterior capsular opacification, aqueous flare, cellular reaction, capsular adhesion, and capsular stability show a polyacrylic elastomer to be the most highly biointegrated IOLs by the human eye.\nMost evidence published in peer-reviewed journals suggests a clear IOL choice for cataract surgeons. In the field of implantable medical devices, one device in a category does not usually provide consistently superior performance of its intended function. The ability of the biomaterial to maintain a clear optical axis not only by suppressing the proliferation of lens epithelial cells, and thus inhibiting posterior capsular opacification formation and obviating the need for an Nd:YAG capsulotomy, but also by adhering to and stabilizing the capsular bag is, to date, unmatched by any other IOL available.",
        "There is scientific and public concern about commonly used chemicals, including phthalates, that are associated with reproductive toxicity in laboratory animals and are hormonally active. People are exposed to phthalates through diet, consumer products and medical devices. The present study explored whether environmental levels of phthalates are associated with altered semen quality in humans.\nWe recruited 168 men who were part of subfertile couples and who presented to the Massachusetts General Hospital andrology laboratory for semen analysis between January 2000 and April 2001. Semen parameters were dichotomized based on 1999 World Health Organization reference values for sperm concentration (< 20 million/ml) and motility (< 50% motile), as well as Tygerberg Strict criteria for morphology (< 4% normal). The comparison group was men for whom these semen parameters were all above the reference values. In urine, eight phthalate metabolites were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Specific gravity-adjusted phthalate metabolite levels were categorized into tertiles.\nThere was a dose-response relation between tertiles of mono-butyl phthalate and sperm motility (odds ratio per tertile = 1.0, 1.8, 3.0; P-value for trend = 0.02) and sperm concentration (1.0, 1.4, 3.3; P-value for trend = 0.07). In addition, there was a dose-response relation between tertiles of mono-benzyl phthalate and sperm concentration (1.0, 1.4, 5.5; P-value for trend = 0.02).\nThere were dose-response relations for monobutyl phthalate and monobenzyl phthalate with one or more semen parameters, and suggestive evidence for monomethyl phthalate with sperm morphology. The lack of a relation for other phthalates may indicate a difference in spermatotoxicity among phthalates.",

        "A platform of thin polymer coatings was introduced for the functional modulation of immobilized bioactive molecules at solid/liquid interfaces. The approach is based on covalently attached alternating maleic acid anhydride copolymers with a variety of comonomers and extended through conversion of the anhydride moieties by hydrolysis, reaction with functional amines, and other conversions of the anhydride moieties. We demonstrate that these options permit control of the physicochemical constraints for bioactive molecules immobilized at interfaces to influence important performance characteristics of biofunctionalized materials for medical devices and molecular diagnostics. Examples concern the impact of the substrate-anchorage of fibronectin on the formation of cell-matrix adhesions, the orientation of endothelial cells according to lateral anti-adhesive micropatterns using grafted poly(ethylene oxide), and the spacer-dependent activity of immobilized synthetic thrombin inhibitors.",
        "Phosphorylcholine (PC)-based polymers have been used in a variety of medical device applications to improve biocompatibility. Here, solutions containing poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) and 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine-co-lauryl methacrylate (MPC-co-LMA(2)) copolymer were spin-coated onto glass coverslips at various ratios ranging from 5:1 to 1:0 for each of the two components, respectively. The resulting blend coatings were shown to be phase-separated on the nanometre-scale by atomic force microscopy, the PC copolymer within the blend being preferentially expressed at the surface. The adsorption of two key blood proteins, fibrinogen and albumin were investigated using surface plasmon resonance as an indicator of biocompatibility. The adsorption of protein to a biomaterials' surface can then stimulate further biological responses. This study therefore, also investigates the materials ability to elicit an inflammatory response by studying the adhesion of human mononuclear cells to the material surface. The materials ability to support the adhesion and growth of other tissue cells was also evaluated, looking specifically at the adhesion and proliferation of rabbit corneal epithelial cells. Results suggest that the adsorption of proteins and the adhesion of both corneal epithelial cells and mononuclear cells are dependent on the composition of the PBMA:MPC-co-LMA(2) copolymer.",

        "The course of development of total hip replacement (THR) is neither harmonious nor linear. Progress and set-backs alternate. Progress in THR manifests itself through reductions in the number and the severity of complications (infection, aseptic loosening, prematurely worn components, etc.). Innovation is the motor of progress. However, today's innovation may well be tomorrow's revision! Progress has been achieved in part through new implant materials and designs that provide improvements in such things as stress distribution in surrounding bone, tissue compatibility and osseointegration, and resistance to both wear and cyclic fatigue. Of at least equal importance, however, are improvements achieved in operative procedures (e.g., cementing technique) and finally, in clinical quality control: more complete documentation of implant and patient variables, establishment of implant registers, and utilization of outcome studies to guide the course of further development. Causes of failure in THR are numerous. However, unexpected side effects of innovations are the most frequent cause. An innovation may solve one problem, but also creates new ones. Problems in innovation which can lead to failures include: over-generalization of expected patient responses, ignoring past experience or assigning wrong causes to encountered problems, and finally, ignoring the dynamic nature of the living system (which can be described as using \"necro-\" instead of biomechanical thinking). Quality control in both manufacturing and clinical practice has to be improved. The pioneer times have come to an end. Today's patients should have the right to be operated on by a well trained surgeon and to be provided with well tested, well-understood implant materials and devices. Progress in endoprosthetics has led to the present high level of clinical success. Paradoxically, however, success is the greatest obstacle to further progress. This is because the curve of progress as a result of effort expended has turned asymptotic in endoprosthetics, as it does in many endeavors. In such situations the more a product (e.g., surgical implant and procedure, automobile design, computer program) becomes successful, the more efforts (and finances) are needed for further progress. On the other hand, the \"scissors\"--created by crossing what might be feasible with what resources are available--open widely and can cut sharply. In fact, financial restrictions may force orthopaedic surgeons and the medical device and technology industry to turn to lower technologies in the future. However, whatever new developments in endoprosthetics may bring (be they sophistications or simplifications), we must remain open-minded and not assume things to be facts until there is evidence to support them.",

        "To describe the incidence, location, and factors associated with the development of pressure ulcers in patients cared for in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).\nMultisite prospective cohort study.\nThree PICUs contained within freestanding children's hospitals.\nA total of 322 patients, 21 days to 8 yrs of age, on bed rest in the PICU for at least 24 hrs without preexisting pressure ulcers or congenital heart disease.\nPatients were observed up to three times a week for 2 wks, then once a week until PICU discharge for a median of two observation periods (interquartile range, 1-4), reflecting 877 skin assessments. Skin assessments were independently rated, and data collectors were blinded to the assessments of the others.\nPressure ulcers were staged according to the American National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel Consensus Development Conference recommendations. Eighty-six patients (27%) developed 199 pressure ulcers; 139 (70%) were Stage I, 54 (27%) were Stage II, and 6 (3%) were Stage III. Of the 60 Stage II/III pressure ulcers, 19 (32%) involved the head. Stage III pressure ulcers involved the occiput, ear, chest, and coccyx. An additional 27 pressure-related injuries were caused by medical devices. Statistically significant Stage I pressure ulcer predictor variables include the use of mechanical ventilation, mean arterial pressures < or =50 mm Hg, and lower Braden Q scores.\nPICU patients at risk include those supported on mechanical ventilation, those with hypotension, and those who have low Braden Q scores. This study provides unique benchmark data for the general PICU population from which pediatric interventional studies can be designed to reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers in this vulnerable patient population.",

        "An external quality assessment (EQA) survey on 14 fresh-frozen, single-donation sera assigned with reference measurement procedure (RMP) values revealed a mean bias of + 5.2% and + 3.7% for the cholesterol oxidase and the photometric glucose oxidase procedure groups, respectively. Conversely, on lyophilized sera, the same procedure groups showed almost bias-free results, the differences from the RMP values being only -0.8% for cholesterol and + 0.7% for glucose. These data, which are in fairly good agreement with the literature, suggest the existence of artificial matrix effects in processed materials. Therefore they indicate that, currently, assessment of trueness is hampered in many European EQA schemes, as most of them use lyophilized sera. This approach may give a false impression about the trueness of laboratory results as well as carrying the risk that laboratories calibrated on the RMP values of the survey samples could make errors in patient testing. Consequently, if European EQA is willing to fulfil a post-market vigilance function of the performance of in vitro diagnostic medical devices, then the time has come to tackle the problem of the quality of the survey samples. EQA organizers urgently need to make an effort to seek out materials that analytically behave like authentic clinical specimens. In the meantime, alternative approaches should be used. Although not ideal, the special survey described in this article is one of the possibilities. Naturally, it implies logistic problems and increased costs for the individual EQA schemes. However, both can be overcome with the cooperation of the predominantly nationally organized schemes.",
        "Over the past 5 years, many coronary artery surgeons have embraced technology and advanced the field of beating heart surgery to the point where off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is becoming a mature procedure. Enabling technologies are now available for all stages of the procedure, including cardiac positioning, coronary artery stabilization, coronary artery visualization, and performance of the proximal and distal anastomoses. Despite these successes, only a minority of cardiac surgeons performs this procedure routinely. Proponents of OPCAB and the medical device industry will need to continue to develop new technologies to make OPCAB less technically challenging and more widely accepted. Progress towards routine single-vessel off-pump totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass has been slow. Translating the benefits of multivessel OPCAB to an endoscopic setting remains a formidable challenge that will require further technologic breakthroughs.",
        "Hospital-acquired infections caused by enterococci have increased dramatically since the 1970s. Many nosocomial enterococcal bloodstream infections are associated with medical devices such as central venous catheters. The ability to form biofilm on medical devices is a potential virulence trait that may allow enterococci to cause infections in the expanding population of patients managed with such devices. In this study, the hypothesis that increased ability to form biofilm in vitro is associated with medical-device-related infection in vivo was tested. A microplate assay was employed to assess biofilm-forming characteristics of enterococci in 0.9 % (w/v) sodium chloride, an oligotrophic environment, and BHI, a nutrient-rich environment. Results were compared in isolates from different sources of infection. One hundred and nine enterococcal bloodstream isolates were assayed. Biofilm formation on microplates was demonstrated by all Enterococcus faecalis isolates and 16/38 (42 %) Enterococcus faecium isolates. E. faecalis isolates produced significantly more biofilm than E. faecium isolates in both media (P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test). E. faecalis isolates from intravascular-catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) produced significantly more biofilm than non-CRBSI isolates (P < 0.0001), or isolates of uncertain clinical significance (P < 0.0001). Biofilm formed by E. faecium isolates was not significantly affected by culture medium and did not differ between isolates from the different clinical categories. In conclusion, there was significantly more biofilm formed by E. faecalis isolates causing CRBSI compared with isolates from other types of infection or from isolates of uncertain clinical significance. The ability of E. faecalis isolates to form biofilm in vitro appears to be a marker of a virulence trait that enhances the ability of isolates to cause CRBSI.",
        "A number of models exist for assessing encrustation on biomaterials employed as devices in the urinary tract. However, static urine models are suitable only for assessment of biomaterials residing in the bladder and the dynamic models available suffer from a number of disadvantages, notably their complexity and limitation to short-term assessment. The dynamic model described herein is a relatively simple design incorporating the ability to assess a large number of biomaterials in replicate fashion and over long periods of time. The biomaterials tested in the dynamic model conform to the urethral catheter and ureteral stent devices that experience urine flow within the urinary tract. The model was initially validated using Percuflex as a test biomaterial. The mass of calcium and magnesium, representing hydroxyapatite and struvite encrustation, respectively, on Percuflex was detected by atomic absorption spectrometry. No significant differences in encrustation levels were detected either between vessels or between biomaterial positions on any mandrel within the vessels, indicating the suitability of the dynamic model for reproducible determination of biomaterial encrustation. The dynamic model was then used to compare the encrustation of biomaterials commonly employed in urinary-tract devices, namely polyurethane, Percuflex and silicone. Calcium and magnesium levels on polyurethane and Percuflex were shown to be statistically similar, whereas silicone exhibited significantly reduced encrustation. When, subsequently, comparisons were made of biomaterial encrustation between the dynamic model and a static model, calcium and magnesium levels arising from the latter model were significantly higher on each of the biomaterials. However, the same rank order of encrustation resistance was observed for the biomaterials in both models, with silicone performing better than polyurethane or Percuflex. The prediction of in-vivo performance based on in-vitro models of encrustation is often difficult, although the model described provides a more accurate method for assessing the potential of novel and existing biomaterials for use in urinary medical devices requiring flow of urine.",
        "One of the most recent innovations coalescing computer technology and medical care is the further development of integrated medical component technology coupled with a computer subsystem.

        "There is no question that medical devices are becoming more reliable. However, we have had some difficulty finding a satisfactory method for providing persuasive documentary evidence that this improved reliability will allow us to relax our traditional planned maintenance (PM) practices without compromising patient safety. The acceptance and increasing use of Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) by several of the oversight agencies, including the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, provides us with an important opportunity to take another shot at this vexing problem. Using this proven FMEA methodology and some relatively simple rules to quantify the results of the routine PM inspections that all healthcare providers are still performing in considerable abundance, we have developed a method that allows us to reduce the test results to a simple, single measure (the Risk Score) that can be used to characterize the effectiveness and levels of safety of our current PM regimens. When tested on theoretical data and a sample of real PM inspection results, the method provides answers that seem reasonable. Although it will probably require some modification as we begin the standardized data gathering and gain working experience, it is our hope that this new approach will become generally accepted within the industry. This kind of positive response should enable us to persuade the various accrediting and licensing agencies to similarly accept the concept.",

        "Phthalates are plasticizers that are added to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products to impart flexibility and durability. They are produced in high volume and generate extensive though poorly defined human exposures and unique childhood exposures. Phthalates are animal carcinogens and can cause fetal death, malformations, and reproductive toxicity in laboratory animals. Toxicity profiles and potency vary by specific phthalate. The extent of these toxicities and their applicability to humans remains incompletely characterized and controversial. Two phthalates, diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and diisononyl phthalate (DINP), have received considerable attention recently because of specific concerns about pediatric exposures. Like all phthalates, DEHP and DINP are ubiquitous contaminants in food, indoor air, soils, and sediments. DEHP is used in toys and medical devices. DINP is a major plasticizer used in children's toys. Scientific panels, advocacy groups, and industry groups have analyzed the literature on DEHP and DINP and have come to different conclusions about their safety. The controversy exists because risk to humans must be extrapolated from animal data that demonstrate differences in toxicity by species, route of exposure, and age at exposure and because of persistent uncertainties in human exposure data. This report addresses sensitive endpoints of reproductive and developmental toxicity and the unique aspects of pediatric exposures to phthalates that generate concern.

        "20 patients with systemic contact dermatitis due to nickel are described. Of these patients, 15 were female and 5 were male. Their mean age was 24.8 years (16-51 years). All had experienced contact dermatitis in the umbilical area due to continual contact with metal belt-buckles or buttons. Then, with long- or short-term aggravation of such periumbilical dermatitis, commonly in summer, lesions spread to other sites such as the side of the neck, the flexures of the extremities, etc. All patients showed a positive patch test to nickel sulphate (2.5% in petrolatum) and the dimethylglyoxime test demonstrated the presence of free nickel on metal buttons or belt-buckles. Punch biopsies performed in 7 patients showed subacute dermatitis. After avoidance of continual exposure to objects containing nickel and foods rich in nickel, as well as treatment with oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids, all patients improved or cleared. It has been reported that nickel can cause systemic contact dermatitis by some internal systemic route, such as oral intake, transfusion, inhalation, implantation of metal medical devices, etc. In our patients, we found that continual local skin contact could also elicit systemic contact dermatitis.",
        "Magnetic field strength measurements were made around eight hand-held and 10 walk-through metal detectors. The method was similar to that used in previous research for Electronic Article Surveillance units except a Cartesian rather than cylindrical coordinate system was used. Special magnetic field probes specifically designed for metal detector measurements were used. A non-metallic positioning apparatus was designed and fabricated. Magnetic field strength measurements were collected on one hand-held metal detector in the laboratory. The remaining data were collected at airport terminals, federal and state government buildings, and a local high school. Walk-through metal detectors had considerably higher magnetic field strengths [up to 299 Am(-1) p-p (3,741 mG)] than hand-held metal detectors [up to 6 Am(-1) p-p (76 mG)]. The frequencies of the magnetic field signal for walk-through detectors were between 0.1 kHz and 3.5 kHz while those for hand-held detectors were between 89 kHz and 133 kHz. Waveforms for all hand-held metal detectors were sinusoidal; those for walk-through metal detectors varied with most being saw-toothed or pulsed. Due to their higher field strengths and the pulsed nature of their magnetic fields, walk-through metal detectors likely pose a higher risk for medical device electromagnetic interference than do hand-held units. Root mean squared magnetic field strengths were calculated from the peak-to-peak values and compared to occupational and general public exposure limits. None of these limits were exceeded. Measurement repeatability was examined for one hand-held and two walk-through metal detectors. For the hand-held metal detector measurements at the location of the maximum magnetic field strength, measurements by three individuals had a repeatability (percent standard deviation) of 5.9%. Limited repeatability data were collected for on-site measurements of walk-through detectors. One unit showed repeatability of 0.1 to 4.5%; a multi-zone unit showed repeatability of 2.7 to 67.5%.",

But Freitas disagreed: \"If you want dollars, you have to show how you fit in with [management's] plans. You must be willing to fight for resources with the rest of us.\" Barton bristled: \"Don't you see that my department is connected to all the others? Every division benefits from the HR budget.\" But she knew Freitas was right. She needed to make the case that doubling her budget was a smart move even in tough times. The question was, How? Four commentators--Susan Burnett, an HR executive at Hewlett-Packard; Mike Morrison, dean of the University of Toyota; Noel M. Tichy, professor at the University of Michigan Business School; and David Owens, vice president of Bausch & Lomb's corporate university--offer advice in this fictional case study.",

At each meeting of the Society of Otorhinolaryngology and Head-Neck Nurses (SOHN) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) the FDA is repeatedly mentioned, and not always favorably!

        "The surface characteristics of intravenously administered particulate drug carriers decisively influence the protein adsorption that is regarded as a key factor for the in vivo fate of the carriers. Latex nanoparticles were synthesized to study the influence of different basic and acidic functional groups on particulate surfaces on the protein adsorption from human serum. The protein mass adsorbed to the particles was assessed by BCA protein assay, the protein adsorption patterns were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Considerable differences in the protein adsorption with regard to preferential adsorbed proteins were detectable for the different functional groups. Possible correlations between the surface characteristics and the protein adsorption are shown and discussed. The knowledge concerning the interactions of proteins and nanoparticles can be used for a rational development of particulate drug carriers and can also be useful for an optimized design of medical devices, e.g., hemodialysis membranes or implants.",
        "A number of countries worldwide have structured horizon scanning systems which provide timely information on the impact of new health technologies to decision makers in health care. In general, the agencies that are responsible for horizon scanning have limited resources in terms of budget and staff. In contrast, the number of new and emerging health technologies, i.e. pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and medical and surgical procedures, is growing rapidly. This requires the Horizon Scanning Systems (HSSs) to devise efficient procedures for identification of new health technologies. The role of the Internet for this purpose has as yet not been documented.\nTo describe and analyse how the Internet is used by horizon scanning systems to systematically identify new health technologies.\nA questionnaire was developed and distributed among 10 agencies known to work within this specific area. The questionnaire specifically focussed on type of sites scanned, frequency of scanning, and importance of a site for the identification of a new health technology.\nA 100% response rate was obtained. Seven out of 10 agencies used the Internet to systematically identify new health technologies, of which 6 provided complete information. A total of 110 web sites were scanned by these 6 agencies. The number of sites scanned per agency ranged from 11 to 27. Most sites were scanned weekly (41%) or monthly (33%). Thirty-one percent (31%) of the total number of sites was considered as highly important. The agencies spent at least 2 hours a week and at most 8 hours per week scanning the Internet. Although each agency's remit differed somewhat in scope, on average the same types of sites were scanned. These include sites from regulatory agencies, sites with information on new drugs or new devices, and sites with news from newswires. However, within these types there was not much correlation between the individual sites that agencies judged important to scan.\nThe use of the Internet for identifying new health technologies is increasing in the majority of horizon scanning systems around the world. At the same time there is considerable variation between individual agencies in their approach to this source of information. This can only be partially explained by differences in scope of scanning activities of the individual agencies. A coordinated effort to develop Internet search strategies for either different categories of health technologies or different clinical specialties may improve efficiency and quality of scanning in terms of the number of potentially relevant technologies identified.",
        "Amorphous carbon films have attracted much attention recently due to their good biocompatibility. Diamond-like carbon (DLC), one form of amorphous carbon that is widely used in many kinds of industries, has been proposed for use in blood contacting medical devices. However, the blood coagulation mechanism on DLC in a biological environment is not well understood. Platelet adhesion and activation are crucial events in the interactions between blood and the materials as they influence the subsequent formation of thrombus. In this work, the behavior of platelets adhered onto hydrogenated amorphous carbon films (a-C:H) is investigated. Hydrogenated amorphous carbon films with different hydrogen contents, structures, and chemical bonds were fabricated at room temperature using plasma immersion ion implantation-deposition (PIII-D). The wettability of the films was investigated by contact angle measurements using several common liquids. Platelet adhesion experiments were conducted to examine the interaction of blood with the films in vitro and the activation of adherent platelets. The results show that the behavior of the platelets adhered on the a-C:H films is influenced by their structure and chemical bond, and it appears that protein interaction plays a key role in the activation of the adherent platelets.",
        "Polycarbonate-polyurethanes (PCNUs) have provided the medical device industry with practical alternatives to oxidation-sensitive polyether-urethanes (PEUs). To date, many studies have focused on PCNUs synthesized with 4,4'-methylene diphenyl-diisocyanate (MDI). The relative hydrolytic stability of this class of polyurethanes is actually quite surprising given the inherent hydrolytic potential of the aliphatic carbonate group. Yet, there has been little information reporting on the rationale for the material's demonstrated hydrolytic stability. Recent work has shown that PCNU materials have a strong sensitivity towards hydrolysis when changes are made to their hard segment content and/or chemistry. However, knowledge is specifically lacking in regards of the identification of cleavage sites and the specific nature of the biodegradation products. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, radiolabel tracers and mass spectrometry, the current study provides insight into the distribution of biodegradation products from the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of five different PCNUs. The hydrolytic sensitivity of the materials is shown to be related to the distribution of products, which itself is a direct consequence of unique micro-structures formed within the different materials. While an MDI-based polymer was shown to be the most hydrolytically stable material, it was the only PCNU that produced its diamine analog, in this case 4,4'-methylene dianiline (MDA), as a degradation product. Given the concern over aromatic diamine toxicity, this finding is important and highlights the fact that relative biostability is a distinct issue from that of degradation product toxicity, and that both must be considered separately when assessing the impact of biodegradation on biomaterial in vivo compatibility.",

Among patients who receive hemostasis devices, the risk of these events are disproportionately greater in women.",
        "For native and engineered biological tissues, there exist many physiological, surgical, and medical device applications where multiaxial material characterization and modeling is required. Because biological tissues and many biocompatible elastomers are incompressible, planar biaxial testing allows for a two-dimensional (2-D) stress-state that can be used to fully characterize their three-dimensional (3-D) mechanical properties. Biological tissues exhibit complex mechanical behaviors not easily accounted for in classic elastomeric constitutive models. Accounting for these behaviors by careful experimental evaluation and formulation of constitutive models continues to be a challenging area in biomechanical modeling and simulation. The focus of this review is to describe the application of multiaxial testing techniques to soft tissues and their relation to modern biomechanical constitutive theories.",
        "A halo orthosis is a medical device used to limit the motion of the skull and cervical spine in order to properly heal an injury sustained in the cervical spine. A difficulty with current halo designs is that the pins which engage the skull can become loose over time. This pin loosening is caused by the inability of halo systems to adapt to small changes in skull geometry due to abrasion, remodeling, and stress relaxation at the pin sites. The inability to adapt is caused by the over-constrained mobility of current halo systems. To address this issue, a nearly exactly-constrained halo prototype that can adapt to most changes in the skull geometry was designed and fabricated. The prototype was tested using a device that simulates the natural geometry changes in the skull. The prototype retains an average of 93% of the initial pin force over a radial recession in the skull of 0.95 mm at each pin site. Comparatively, the current clinical four pin halo only retains an average of 11% of the initial pin force with 1 mm radial recession at each pin site.",
        "Bench testing with databases of pre-recorded physiological signals is a common step in the verification and validation of medical devices. For example, in the case of an electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor to be tested, the physiological signals are ECG tracings that have previously been recorded from patients using other ECG monitors. Human overreaders then annotate the tracings to determine the occurrence of significant clinical events such as ventricular tachycardia. These annotations can be used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the ECG monitor to be tested. This article aims to highlight some issues associated with such bench testing, such as the way the pre-recorded signals are presented to the medical device to be tested, the adequacy of single channel versus dual channel versus multi-channel testing in the bench testing, and the need for the human overreaders and the medical device to use the same set of rules for determining the occurrence of a clinical event. These issues are also applicable to other monitors such as the apnea monitor. Some suggestions for addressing the issues are presented.",

In 1986 Occupational Safety and Health Administration was petitioned by various unions representing health care employees to develop a standard which protects employees from occupational exposure to blood-borne diseases. Congress passed the Needle Stick Safety and Prevention Act. This specifies that \"safer medical devices, such as sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needle-less systems\" constitute an effective engineering control, and must be used where feasible. This has been mandated in California as part of the labor code. Blood-borne pathogens of concern in needle stick injuries are human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis virus B, and hepatitis virus C.\nThe objective of this study was to determine the incidence of accidental needlesticks (ANSs) and disease transmission in the allergy setting.\nA retrospective survey of most California allergy practices and a few large multi-physician allergy practices. We received and used 121 of 400 surveys.\nAnalysis of the survey data showed an overall incidence of 45 ANSs with 7.026 million 26-/27-gauge needles reported. There was zero rate of disease transmission; 6.41 ANSs per million compares favorably with an estimated 267 ANSs per million in the general medical setting.\nThe rate of ANSs in the allergist's office is 2% that of general medical ANSs. The current \"safety\" needles have no proven effectiveness. There is no reported disease transmission in the allergist's office setting using existent methods. This solution needs further study before there is generalized implementation of the engineering devices of no proven effectiveness that may in fact increase ANSs.",
        "Immunocompromised patients are at high risk of developing Candida infections. Although cell-mediated immunity is generally believed to play the main role in defence against fungi, antibodies could also be effective in immune defence by different mechanisms of action. The adherence capacity of four strains of Candida albicans to polystyrene and to some extracellular matrix components was investigated after incubation of the yeasts with non-specific and specific anti-C. albicans IgG. Experiments were carried out using a colorimetric method based upon the reduction of XTT tetrazolium (2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) by mitochondrially active blastospores in the presence of menadione. Incubation of the yeasts with IgG, specific or not, caused a decrease in the capacity for adherence to the surfaces studied. There was no significant effect of the specificity of the tested antibodies on the reduction of adherence capacity. In conclusion, total IgG could play a role in blocking the binding of C. albicans to host and medical device surfaces. These results suggest that regular survey of levels of total IgG in patients suffering from severe hypogammaglobulinaemia could be of interest for the prevention of systemic candidiasis.",

        "As an extracorporeal technique for blood purification, haemoadsorption was introduced in the early 1960s along with other physico-chemical methods. The problem of poor biocompatibility of uncoated adsorbents was resolved by coating adsorbent granules with haemocompatible membranes. Use of coated adsorbents instead of uncoated ones reduces the efficiency of haemoperfusion. As a result, for many years the use of adsorption was limited to only acute poisoning. Since the 1990s interest in the use of adsorbents in extracorporeal medical devices has been rising again. In this paper some recent developments in synthesis and application of novel uncoated medical adsorbents are discussed.",

Included are definitions of medical devices and in vitro diagnostics, and a brief history of their treatment by European law. The erosion of boundaries between exclusive and shared responsibilities of the EU and member states will be addressed, especially as it affects market approval of medical devices, clinical investigations, labeling and instructions for use, price setting and reimbursement, and evidence-based medicine and healthcare technology assessment. Finally, the article discusses medical device reporting and surveillance systems, which may be the weakest link in the EU integrative process. If patient safety is as important to the EU regulatory scheme as free movement and competitiveness, then both Brussels and member states will require additional resources, as well as measures to overcome obstacles to implementation, evaluation, and accountability.",
        "In our laboratory sulfonated PEO (PEO-SO(3)) was designed as a \"negative cilia model\" to investigate a synergistic effect of PEO and negatively charged SO(3) groups. PEO-SO(3) itself exhibited a heparin-like anticoagulant activity of 14% of free heparin. Polyurethane grafted with PEO-SO(3) (PU-PEO-SO(3)) increased the albumin adsorption to a great extent but suppressed other proteins, while PU-PEO decreased the adsorption of all the proteins. The platelet adhesion was decreased on PU-PEO but least on PU-PEO-SO(3) to demonstrate an additional effect of SO(3) groups. The enhanced blood compatibility of PU-PEO-SO(3) in the ex vivo rabbit and in vivo canine implanting tests was confirmed. Furthermore, PU-PEO-SO(3) exhibited an improved biostability and suppressed calcification in addition to the enhanced antithrombogenicity. The in vivo antithrombogenicity and biostability were improved in the order of PU<PU-PEO<PU-PEO-SO(3). The calcium amounts deposited was decreased in the order of PU>PU-PEO>PU-PEO-SO(3) in spite of the possible attraction between negative SO(3) groups and positive calcium ions. The bioprosthetic tissue (BT) was grafted with H(2)N-PEO-SO(3) via glutaraldehyde (GA) residues after conventional GA fixation. BT-PEO-SO(3) also displayed the decreased calcification by in vivo animal models. The application of PEO-SO(3) was extended by designing amphiphilic copolymers containing PEO-SO(3) moiety and hydrophobic long alkyl groups as anchors. The superior effect of PEO-SO(3) groups on thromboresistance compared to PEO was confirmed also in the case of copolymers coated or blended with other polymers and the systems coupled by UV irradiation, photoreaction or gold/sulfur or silane coupling technology, and therefore it might be very useful for the medical devices.",

        "To measure patients' risk for acquiring antibiotic-resistant microorganisms associated with intensive care unit admission.\nProspective, observational study.\nTen public hospitals including one university medical center.\nConsecutive patients admitted to ten intensive care units.\nSerial patient surveillance cultures were screened for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), ceftazidime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CR-GNB), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and antibiotic and medical device exposures.\nA total of 1,697 patient admissions in ten intensive care units were enrolled. The overall carriage rate of antibiotic-resistant bacteria at intensive care unit entry was 12.1% for MRSA, 14% for CR-GNB and 4.7% for both. At discharge from the intensive care unit, new carriage of MRSA, CR-GNB, and both was found in 11.1%, 14.2%, and 2.4% of the patients, respectively. The acquisition rates in the individual units correlated highly and positively with proportion of patients with carriage at intensive care unit entry for both MRSA (n = 10, Pearson's r =.89, p < 0.001) and CR-GNB (n = 10, Pearson's r =.92, p < 0.001). By logistic regression, severity of illness (odds ratio, 1.4), length of stay (odds ratio, 1.7), use of penicillins (odds ratio, 1.9), and number of antibiotics (odds ratio, 1.2) and medical devices (odds ratio, 1.2) were independently associated with intensive care unit acquisition of MRSA. In comparison, variables independently associated with intensive care unit acquisition of CR-GNB were Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1.5), number of antibiotics (odds ratio, 1.1), and artificial airway (odds ratio, 1.5).\nThese data suggest that hospitalization in the intensive care unit introduces significant risk to patients in terms of transmission of MRSA and/or CR-GNB. This risk seems to be influenced strongly by the proportion of patients with colonization at intensive care unit admission and is associated with severity of illness, length of stay, and exposures to antibiotics and medical devices.",
        "Colonization of implanted medical devices by coagulase-negative staphylococci such as Staphylococcus epidermidis is mediated by the bacterial polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), a polymer of beta-(1-->6)-linked glucosamine substituted with N-acetyl and O-succinyl constituents. The icaADBC locus containing the biosynthetic genes for production of PIA has been identified in both S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Whereas it is clear that PIA is a constituent that contributes to the virulence of S. epidermidis, it is less clear what role PIA plays in infection with S. aureus. Recently, identification of a novel polysaccharide antigen from S. aureus termed poly N-succinyl beta-(1-->6)-glucosamine (PNSG) has been reported. This polymer was composed of the same glycan backbone as PIA but was reported to contain a high proportion of N-succinylation rather than acetylation. We have isolated a glucosamine-containing exopolysaccharide from the constitutive over-producing MN8m strain of S. aureus in order to prepare polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines. In this report we demonstrate that MN8m produced a high-molecular-weight (>300,000 Da) polymer of beta-(1-->6)-linked glucosamine containing 45-60% N-acetyl, and a small amount of O-succinyl (approx 10% mole ratio to monosaccharide units). By detailed NMR analyses of polysaccharide preparations, we show that the previous identification of N-succinyl was an analytical artifact. The exopolysaccharide we have isolated is active in in vitro hemagglutination assays and is immunogenic in mice when coupled to a protein carrier. We therefore conclude that S. aureus strain MN8m produces a polymer that is chemically and biologically closely related to the PIA produced by S. epidermidis.",
        "The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) established three regulatory classes for medical devices. Section 513 of the Act specifies three classes based upon the degree of control and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight that is necessary to assure that the various types of devices are safe and effective. High-risk devices are placed into the most regulated device class, Class III. Under Section 515 of the Act, all devices placed in Class III are subject to premarket approval (PMA) requirements. PMA by FDA is the required process of scientific review to ensure the safety and effectiveness of Class III devices. Advisory panel review is required of virtually all original submissions. Manufacturing facilities of devices requiring PMA approval are also subject to preapproval inspection to assure data integrity and compliance with good manufacturing practices. An approved PMA is granted for marketing a particular medical device for a particular intended use. FDA considers noninvasive and minimally invasive glucose devices that are intended to measure, monitor, or predict blood glucose levels in diabetics to be high-risk medical devices. These devices will have a significant potential impact on the medical care of people with diabetes. The technology offers potential improvements in the quality of life, enhanced blood glucose control through increased frequency of testing, or access to testing, in a broader range of patients. However, the technology is not yet well understood, and the information obtained from these devices is often different from the information that has been the traditional base for the management of diabetes.

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a new thermoregulatory device, the Arctic Sun temperature-controlling circulating fluid adhesive pad system, in preventing hypothermia during OPCAB surgery.\nThirteen consenting patients undergoing OPCAB had their temperature managed using the Arctic Sun system. They were matched with 23 consenting control OPCAB patients whose temperature was maintained with standardized, conventional therapy (elevated ambient operating room temperature, warmed intravenous fluids, and a convective forced air warming system placed under the surgical drapes). Nasopharyngeal temperature (recorded at 1-minute intervals) was compared between the two groups by analysis of both the time and area under the curve for a temperature less than 36 degrees C.\nMultivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the average amount of hypothermia in the Arctic Sun group was significantly less than in the control group, both for time spent less than 36 degrees C (20.7 vs 121.3 minutes, p = 0.0004) and for area under the curve less than 36 degrees C (11.8 degrees C vs 78.1 degrees C x minutes, p = 0.0001).\nThe Arctic Sun temperature-controlling system is more effective than conventional warming methods in preventing hypothermia during OPCAB surgery.",

        "Although pharmacologic therapy has made impressive advances in the past decade and is the mainstay of therapy for heart failure (HF), there is still a large unmet need, because morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high. Implanted medical devices are gaining increasing utility in this group of patients and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of HF. The majority of devices in clinical use or under active investigation in HF can be grouped into 1 of 4 categories: devices to monitor the HF condition, devices to treat rhythm disturbances, devices to improve the mechanical efficiency of the heart, and devices to replace part or all of the heart's function. There are several devices either approved or under development to monitor the HF condition, ranging from interactive weight scales to implantable continuous pressure monitors. The challenge is to demonstrate that this technology can improve patient outcomes. Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are used to treat heart rhythms in a broad range of patients with heart disease, but they now have a special place in HF management with the prophylactic use of ICDs in patients who have advanced systolic dysfunction. The Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT) II study demonstrated a 29% reduction in all-cause mortality with ICDs in patients with a history of a myocardial infarction and a left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction <0.30. LV and multisite pacing are means of improving the mechanical efficiency of the heart. The concept is to create a more coordinated contraction of the ventricles to overcome the inefficiency associated with conduction system delays, which are common in HF. The acute hemodynamic effect can be impressive and is immediate. Several studies of intermediate duration (3 to 6 months) have consistently demonstrated that biventricular pacing improves symptoms and exercise capacity. Mechanical methods of remodeling the heart into a more efficient shape have been under scrutiny for several years. New methods of restraining the heart with prosthetic material are under investigation in humans, with encouraging pilot results. Heart replacement has been evaluated clinically with LV assist devices for several decades. The Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance Therapy as an Alternative in Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) study has demonstrated a proof of concept for the use of mechanical blood pumps to improve survival, functional capacity, and symptoms. Several assist devices with such features as total implantability, improved durability, and smaller size are now under study; these may further improve the outcomes of patients. One year ago, the world witnessed the first clinical use of a totally implantable total artificial heart. Although the long-term outcomes were limited, the device demonstrated an impressive ability to improve organ function and extend survival in the population facing imminent death. Further development in this field is expected. The use of devices in HF now has a strong foothold, and the potential exists for substantially greater use of a broad range of devices in the near future.",
        "Health Canada reported recently that medical devices containing di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) should not be used in the clinical treatment of infants, young boys, pregnant women, and nursing mothers. The risk assessment of DEHP released from PVC medical devices is an important issue for hospitalized patients. In this study, a simple, accurate, low-contamination and high-throughput analytical technique for the determination of DEHP in intravenous (IV) solution was developed using column-switching liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) with an extraction mini-column. The sample preparation for on-line extraction involved simply mixing IV solution with internal standard as DEHP-d(4) in LC glass vials. The IV fat emulsion drug sample cannot be analyzed directly, hence this sample spiked with DEHP-d(4) solution was extracted by hexane and measured by column-switching LC/MS yielding an average recovery of 92.2% (C.V.=7.8%, n=5). A linear response was found for a variety of drugs tested within the validated range of 0.1 or 0.5-10 microg/ml with correlation coefficients (r) greater than 0.99. These results suggest that this method can assay background exposure to DEHP released from PVC medical devices in the patients. The method was applied to various IV solution samples to establish the first screening method for DEHP released from medical devices with respect to their safety.",
        "The Czech External Quality Assessment Scheme organized a survey using 14 fresh-frozen sera targeted for cholesterol and glucose by reference measurement procedures. The objective was to investigate whether it could fulfil a post-market vigilance function for in vitro diagnostic medical devices and assess trueness of participants' results. It revealed a mean bias of +5.1% for cholesterol and +3.7% for glucose (n approximately 150). However, the bias source (manufacturer or laboratory) could not be identified unequivocally because of the lack of homogeneous groups. This was due to the fact that laboratories mainly used reagents from manufacturers that do not market instruments or combined calibrators and reagents from different sources. Consequently, these habits did not allow the survey to fulfil the vigilance function. On the other hand, we were able to show the individual participants results for patient samples deviating from the true value (deviations >10% in approximately 20% of the laboratories). However, again, the survey failed in problem-solving via peer-group evaluation, even for participants that applied homogeneous tests. If other European schemes confirm this outcome, cooperation and/or participation of manufacturers may be the solution. The survey pointed out to the other participants, interchanging instrument, reagent and calibrator, that they are themselves responsible for the problems shown and hence also for problem-solving.",
        "The authors review the various bone substitutes which are currently available on the market place in Belgium. After describing the requirements for clinical use of such materials, they compare the biological and mechanical values of bone autografts, bone allografts, demineralised bone, xenografts, coral and synthetic materials such as calcium sulfate, calcium phosphate, ionic cement and bioactive glass. They stress the current paucity of data pertaining to the biological value of these materials and call for in vivo validation tests. They also review biomolecules such as BMP-2 or OP-1, whose osteoinductive properties are currently under investigation. Finally, they present the emergent field of cell therapy, in which osteoprogenitor cells are isolated from the patient's bone marrow and reinjected after in vitro cultivation. They stress the therapeutic and medicolegal problems raised by the combination of medical devices, grafts, medicinal products and cells, all of which have a different status within the complex European legal framework.",
        "Modern pharmaceuticals and medical devices have provided substantial benefits to patients throughout the world. These benefits come at a high and increasing cost, with development of the typical pharmaceutical requiring 12 years and hundreds of millions of dollars before gaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration marketing approval. Appropriate use of imaging biomarkers--defined as anatomic, physiologic, biochemical, or molecular parameters detectable with imaging methods used to establish the presence or severity of disease--offer the prospect of smaller, less expensive, and more efficient preclinical studies and clinical trials. Scientists, government regulators, and industry have all recognized the potential of biomarkers in imaging. Although real, this promise can only be realized with the rigorous application of science to their use. Success is most likely when (a) the presence of an imaging marker is closely linked with the presence of a target disease; (b) detection and/or measurement of the biomarker is accurate, reproducible, and feasible over time; and (c) measured changes are closely linked to success or failure of the therapeutic effect of the product being evaluated. By applying this paradigm to the array of imaging modalities, the radiology community is poised to become a major force in preclinical and clinical evaluations of new medical treatments.",
        "Acne vulgaris is an exceedingly common condition in adolescence and may extend into adult life in some individuals. Even though this condition is at times minimized, it has been found to have a profound impact in the quality of life of many affected individuals. Acne scarring can be even more of a source of psychological and social problems than active acne is, and when inadequately treated, the latter can lead to the former. Moderate and severe acne vulgaris usually require a regimen of systemic and/or topical medications, which are given for several months or even years and frequently require multiple visits to the physician office, the laboratory, etc. This results in loss of time at school and considerable expense. Side effects from medications and the frequent need to use alternative drugs when there is no response to medical treatment are possible.\nTo evaluate the role of a novel medical device that uses radiofrequency as a source of energy to produce volumetric tissue heating, while sparing the epidermis, allowing for a procedure with no down time and no postoperative care required.\nTwenty-two patients, 10 women and 12 men, ranging in age from 16 to 28, with moderate to severe, scarring, cystic, active, acne vulgaris participated. Only nine of these patients were on concomitant medical treatment such as oral antibiotics or topical agents. All 22 patients were treated with a new nonablative radiofrequency unit, which delivers a concomitant spray of cryogen for epidermal sparing. One session was done in 20 patients and two sessions in 2 patients. The average fluence per energy delivery was 72 J/cm2. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 8 months. Patient questionnaires and active acne lesion counts were used to evaluate the response to treatment.\nExcellent response was seen in 82% (n=18). Modest response was seen in 9% (n=2), and no response was seen in 9% (n=2); t-test on active lesion counts before treatment and after treatment was less than 0.009004. No side effects were identified on any of these patients. No down time from the procedure was seen. Only topical anesthesia, ELA-Max 5% (Ferndale Labs, Ferndale, MI) was used; 59% of patients were on no acne medication before, during, or after the procedure.\nNonablative radiofrequency appears to be a new safe and effective treatment alternative for moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Further research is in progress to evaluate this treatment modality in a larger number of patients.",
        "Bloodborne pathogen exposures remain a significant occupational hazard to all health care professionals. Primary preventive strategies, such as standard precautions and the availability of the hepatitis B vaccine to all health care workers, have been instrumental in decreasing the potential for life threatening exposures to HBV, HCV, and HIV. Updated work practices and engineering controls, including the use of safer medical devices, will continue to further reduce the potential risk of exposures to workers. Occupational health clinicians are in a pivotal position to foster primary preventive strategies. Ongoing education to health care professionals about the general prevalence, risk of transmission, and availability of prophylaxis and treatment is imperative. Knowledge related to the importance of taking basic precautions through the use of gloves, gowns, and masks has been proven to decrease exposure incidents. Many health professionals are experts in their specialty areas, but are unfamiliar with the latest data related to the prevention and treatment of exposures to bloodborne pathogens. Some perceive they are at little risk, and others have untoward fears. Secondary preventive intervention strategies are evolving each year through the use of new prophylactic medications for HIV and the possibility of prophylaxis for HCV. Occupational health clinicians must be updated about the latest strategies for the management of bloodborne pathogen exposures (see Appendix for a list of resources).",
        "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that it has reclassified two fixed-bearing knee joint prostheses, the knee joint patellofemorotibial metal/polymer porous-coated uncemented prosthesis, which is intended to be implanted to replace a knee joint, and the knee joint femorotibial (uni-compartmental) metal/polymer porous-coated uncemented prosthesis, which is intended to be implanted to replace part of a knee joint. FDA has reclassified the devices from class III (premarket approval) into class II (special controls). The special control that will apply is a guidance document entitled \"Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Knee Joint Patellofemorotibial and Femorotibial Metal/Polymer Porous-Coated Uncemented Prostheses; Guidance for Industry and FDA.\" The agency is reclassifying these devices into class II because special controls, in addition to general controls, will provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the devices, and there is sufficient information to establish special controls.

        "The phenomenon of electromagnetic interference by mobile phones is real and potentially clinically significant. This has been recognised by the Department of Health and the Medical Devices Agency, leading to bans on phone use in hospitals. Current evidence suggests that mobile phones can cause malfunction of medical equipment, but only when used in close proximity. Allowing phone use in non-patient care areas and improving staff education may improve compliance with hospital policies.",
        "In order to guarantee the consistently high quality of medical products for human use, it is absolutely necessary that flawless hygiene conditions are maintained by the strict observance of hygiene rules. With the growing understanding of the impact of process conditions on the quality of the resulting product, process controls (surveillance) have gained increasing importance to complete the quality profile traditionally defined by post-process product testing. Today, process controls have become an important GMP requirement for the pharmaceutical industry. However, before quality process controls can be introduced, the manufacturing process has to be analyzed, with the focus on its critical quality-influencing steps. The HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) method is well recognized as a useful tool in the pharmaceutical industry. This risk analysis, following the guidelines of the HACCP method and the monitoring of critical steps during the manufacturing process was applied to the manufacture of methyl methacrylate solution used for bone cement and led to the establishment of a preventative monitoring system and constitutes an effective concept for quality assurance of hygiene and all other parameters influencing the quality of the product.",
        "In the United States, demineralized bone matrix (DBM) is considered a transplantable tissue and therefore is regulated primarily by the American Association of Tissue Banks. Even though DBM is not subjected to the same regulations relative to performance claims as medical devices are, one would expect different processing methods might yield DBM preparations of different osteoinductive potential. The purpose of this study was to use an established athymic rat model to compare the osteoinductive properties of two commercially available human DBMs prepared using different methods but having essentially identical product claims. Sixteen female athymic rats were used to test equivalent volumes of two lots each of Grafton Putty (Osteotech, Inc., Eatontown, NJ), Osteofil (Regeneration Technologies, Inc., Alachua, FL), and rat DBM. At 28 days after implantation, qualitative and semiquantitative microscopy showed no significant differences in bone formation between the two lots from each source, but rat DBM produced significantly more bone than Grafton, which produced significantly more bone than Osteofil. Our results suggest that methods of graft processing may represent a greater source of variability than do differences among individual donors. Whether these differences relate to methods of demineralization, carrier, dose of DBM per volume, or to some other factor remains to be determined.",

        "Artificial models of cerebral aneurysms for medical training and testing of medical devices were constructed from corrosion casts of the main cerebral arteries of a human specimen. Three aneurysms with a variety of shapes were simulated at typical locations. Rigid and soft models were made of silicone using the \"lost wax\" technique. The transparent silicone models were anatomically accurate and reproducible copies of human vascular casts. These models could be connected in a closed circuit that used an electric pump to simulate pulsatile flow. Endovascular procedures and surgical clip application were performed under fluoroscopic or direct visual control. Surgical clipping, endoluminal coil manipulation, and consecutive hemodynamic changes were visualized by digital subtraction angiography and direct observation. The model provides trainee surgeons with an understanding of clinical conditions. New medical devices, such as platinum coils, would be experimentally implanted in the model under stable conditions. These anatomically accurate and reproducible models of cerebral vasculature and aneurysms are valuable for medical testing, training, and research.",

        "The evolution of biomedical technology has led to an extraordinary use of medical devices in health care delivery. During the last decade, clinical engineering departments (CEDs) turned toward computerization and application of specific software systems for medical equipment management in order to improve their services and monitor outcomes. Recently, much emphasis has been given to patient safety. Through its Medical Device Directives, the European Union has required all member nations to use a vigilance system to prevent the reoccurrence of adverse events that could lead to injuries or death of patients or personnel as a result of equipment malfunction or improper use. The World Health Organization also has made this issue a high priority and has prepared a number of actions and recommendations. In the present workplace, a new integrated, Windows-oriented system is proposed, addressing all tasks of CEDs but also offering a global approach to their management needs, including vigilance. The system architecture is based on a star model, consisting of a central core module and peripheral units. Its development has been based on the integration of 3 software modules, each one addressing specific predefined tasks. The main features of this system include equipment acquisition and replacement management, inventory archiving and monitoring, follow up on scheduled maintenance, corrective maintenance, user training, data analysis, and reports. It also incorporates vigilance monitoring and information exchange for adverse events, together with a specific application for quality-control procedures. The system offers clinical engineers the ability to monitor and evaluate the quality and cost-effectiveness of the service provided by means of quality and cost indicators. Particular emphasis has been placed on the use of harmonized standards with regard to medical device nomenclature and classification. The system's practical applications have been demonstrated through a pilot evaluation trial.",
        "The in vitro hemolytic and in vivo mucosal irritation potential of ethylene oxide (EO) was investigated with standard procedures used to determine the biocompatibility of medical devices. Test solutions containing EO at concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 microg/mL were prepared in saline to simulate a worst-case aqueous extraction of standard medical devices containing 125, 250, 500, 1,250, 2,500, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, or 50,000 microg/g of EO, respectively. Concentrations of EO up to 500 microg/mL were not hemolytic ( < 5% hemolysis after a 4-h exposure), whereas > or =1250 microg/mL of EO resulted in significant hemolysis. Hamster cheek pouches exposed to cotton pellets saturated with EO at concentrations of up to 2500 microg/mL for 4 h with a recovery period of 14 days were without effects attributable to EO. However, at > or =5000 microg/mL of EO, significant histomorphological alterations of the buccal mucosa were observed and attributed to EO exposure. It was concluded that solutions of EO of up to 500 microg/mL representing an aqueous extract of a general medical device containing at least 2500 microg/g of EO residue do not result in significant hemolysis and irritation.",
        "Staphylococcus epidermidis is a frequent cause of infections associated with foreign bodies and indwelling medical devices. The bacteria are capable of surviving antibiotic treatment through encapsulation into biofilms. RNAIII-inhibiting peptide (RIP) is a heptapeptide that inhibits S. aureus pathogenesis by disrupting quorum-sensing mechanisms. In this study, RIP inhibited drug-resistant S. epidermidis biofilm formation through a mechanism similar to that evidenced for S. aureus. RIP is synergistic with antibiotics in eliminating 100% of graft-associated in vivo S. epidermidis infections, which suggests that RIP may be used to coat medical devices to prevent staphylococcal infections. Disruption of cell-cell communication can prevent infections associated with antibiotic-resistant strains.",
        "Since the emergence of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, progressive regulatory strategies have been aimed at decreasing the risk of bloodborne pathogen exposures in health care workers. It is important to understand the evolution of these bloodborne pathogen strategies that have been vital to maintaining the health and safety of workers in potentially high risk environments. Occupational health clinicians need to communicate to employees how each of these strategies has helped decrease the day to day risks health care workers potentially face. Standard precautions remain one of the best ways health care workers can protect themselves against exposures. It has been more than 15 years since standard precautions were first introduced. Some health care workers have become lax in using these very simple techniques. Occupational health clinicians need to remind employees of the importance of taking care of themselves by using proper protective equipment. Recent federal and state needle safe legislation has heightened employee and employer awareness about the importance of new, safer medical devices. These devices [table: see text] must be used properly to truly decrease the potential risks to health care workers. Occupational health care clinicians can be pivotal in the forefront of needle safety initiatives in their institution. Occupational health nurses in health care settings should be active members of needle safe and bloodborne pathogen committees and participate in product evaluation. Clinicians should advocate for employees to be properly trained to use new devices and reinforce the importance of using safety devices properly to employees. The risks of transmission for HIV, HBV, and HCV are indisputable in environments where workers are potentially exposed to blood or body fluids. Knowledge about how exposure occurs, the risks of transmission in health care workers, and preventive strategies available can assist the employee to work safely without unnecessary fear or anxiety. Part II of this article (February 2003) is a more indepth discussion about each of the three bloodborne pathogens of greatest concern to health care workers. The general prevalence, risk groups, prophylaxis, and treatment of HBV, HCV, and HIV are elaborated. Common blood tests for each of these pathogens are also explained.",
        "Following the introduction of single-use-instruments (SUI) for tonsillectomy in January 2001 in UK, the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) received reports of significant increase in secondary haemorrhage in some centres. This was believed to be related to electrosurgical (diathermy) forceps. The aim of this study is to compare post tonsillectomy morbidity before (year 2000) and after (year 2001) the introduction of SUI in a unit where bipolar dissection is the most popular method of dissection.\nThe case notes of all tonsillectomy patients between 20 April and 31 October for the years 2000 (145 patients) and 2001 (166 patients) were reviewed. The patients' age and sex, other concurrent operations, grade of surgeon, dissection and haemostasis methods, length of post operative hospital stay and the reason for prolonged stay (if more than one night) were noted. Readmitted cases were analysed to identify the cause and the management.\nThere was no case of reactionary haemorrhage in both the non SUI (year 2000) and the SUI (year 2001) groups. For the non SUI versus SUI group, 6.2 versus 4.8% stayed more than one night post operatively; 4.8 versus 5.4% were readmitted for secondary haemorrhage with 1.4 versus 2.4% return to theatre to control bleeding, respectively. The average hospital stay for the readmitted cases were 2.1 versus 1.6 days and the average time lapse between tonsillectomy and secondary haemorrhage were 6.7 versus 6 days respectively.\nThere was no significant difference in post tonsillectomy morbidity following the introduction of SUI.",
        "Recent advances in technology have brought many kinds of monitoring devices into the operating room (OR). The information gathered by monitors can be channeled to the operating ward information system via a local area network (LAN). Connecting patients to monitors and monitors to the LAN, however, requires a large number of cables. This wiring is generally inconvenient and particularly troublesome if the layout of the OR is rearranged. From this point of view, wireless transmission seems ideally suited to clinical settings. Currently, two modes of wireless connectivity are available: radio-frequency (RF) waves or infrared (IR) waves. Some reports suggest that RF transmission is likely to cause electromagnetic interference (EMI) in medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers or infusion pumps. The risk of malfunctioning life-sustaining devices and the catastrophic consequences this would have on seriously ill patients rules out the use of RF. Here, we report an IR system using IR modems for LAN connectivity in the OR. In this study, we focused on the possible detrimental effects of EMI during wireless connectivity. In our trial, we found no evidence of EMI of IR modems with any of the medical devices we tested. Furthermore, IR modems showed similar performance to a wired system even in an electrically noisy environment. We conclude that IR wireless connectivity can be safely and effectively used in ORs.",
        "Registered nurses in perioperative settings and managers of perioperative departments must work together to implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these very important federal regulations. If the information is not recorded in the proper manner and shared with the manufacturer, patients' safety is at risk. Without the ability to contact physicians and patients, manufacturers cannot alert individuals appropriately if problems arise with a certain device. Tracking devices in the correct manner ensures that patients can be notified expediently. Nurses and managers should examine their current practices to ensure that they are consistent with federal regulations. A regular assessment should be conducted to ensure that tracking forms are completed in an accurate, timely manner, that permission to release a patient's social security number is obtained, and that the hospital is compliant with the FDA's most up-to-date list of devices that must be tracked. All perioperative staff members must receive education about the tracking process in their particular institution and receive updates when the process or FDA regulations change. Maintain patient safety by ensuring that the medical device tracking process is followed accurately and meets federal regulations.",

        "This report is a review of the published literature for studies of triclosan that address mechanism of action, efficacy on skin and in the oral cavity, and the potential for development of resistance.\nTriclosan citations from the past three decades were searched using Medline and other search engines. The techniques used in these studies included in vitro antimicrobial sensitivity, molecular genetics, and enzyme and membrane biochemistry. Oral cavity efficacy and resistance studies were conducted in human volunteers in trials lasting up to 7 months. Efficacy on skin was reported in clinical trials lasting up to 12 months.\nThe minimal inhibitory concentration of triclosan against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli is reported to be 0.1 and 5.0 microg/mL, respectively. Triclosan acts by blocking enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase, an enzyme essential for fatty acid biosynthesis. Its biocidal activity involves a plethora of nonspecific perturbations of cellular structural elements, including the cell membrane. In the oral cavity, triclosan use was associated with significant reductions in recoverable flora; there was no evidence of resistance or emergence of opportunistic pathogens. On skin, in a neonatal intensive care unit, triclosan use was associated with a significant reduction in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections, a diminished need for antibiotics, and a decreased incidence of nosocomial infections.\nThere is currently no evidence that long-term application of triclosan products to the skin or oral cavity selects for triclosan-resistant populations. Given the short-term nature of suture use, it is highly unlikely that such use would do other than reduce the risks of postoperative infection.",

        "Hydrocortisone-loaded monolithic microspheres were prepared, using a single emulsion solvent evaporation process, from a range of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate copolymers in which both molecular weight and hydroxyvalerate content were varied. Many similarities were observed in the effects of process parameters and co-polymer composition on the morphologies of the microspheres, and the morphologies of microcapsules prepared (and previously reported) by a double emulsion process. The yields of the single emulsion process were generally superior to those of the double emulsion process, although these were adversely affected by hydrocortisone incorporation as the molecular weight of the copolymer was reduced. The predominant effect of hydrocortisone incorporation was on polymer morphology, characterized by the appearance of small surface pores; an effect which increased with increasing drug loading. Changes in polymer molecular weight, copolymer composition and process temperature, together with the incorporation of polycaprolactone in the form of a solvent blend, enabled microspheres with a range of morphologies to be produced providing the potential for control of drug release.",
        "Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) was found to cause selective pulmonary vasodilation in the late 1980's and since then there has been a huge interest in studying its clinical benefits. The equipment used to deliver and monitor inhaled NO has gone through a dramatic evolution from simple flow meters and industrial monitors to to-days purpose built, fully integrated, NO delivery and monitoring systems that were designed specifically for the demanding area of the intensive care unit. This paper explores the evolution of inhaled NO delivery systems and identifies the design challenges, the safety and regulatory requirements and the ease of use issues that had to be solved to bring this new exciting new class of medical device in to clinical use.",
        "This study investigates the influence of treatment of plastic and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins with chlorhexidine or benzalkonium chloride on subsequent adherence of Candida albicans. Three concentrations were tested for each antiseptic: (i) chlorhexidine, MIC (6.25-12.5 mg/L), 80 x MIC and 800 x MIC; and (ii) benzalkonium chloride, MIC (3.12 mg/L), 40 x MIC and 1600 x MIC. Chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride activities were correlated with the tested concentrations. Antiseptics used at MIC were unable to modify the adherence to plastic or ECM proteins. Chlorhexidine (80 x MIC) induced a decrease in plastic adherence of 31% of the 15 strains used and an increase in ECM protein adherence of 13% of strains. Benzalkonium chloride (40 x MIC) induced a decrease in adherence to ECM proteins or plastic of 13-27% of strains. Our results indicated that the treatment with 1600 x MIC benzalkonium chloride could induce the opposite effect on adherence, depending on the surface: 60% of the strains showed an increase in their adherence to ECM proteins, whereas 93% of the strains showed a decrease in their adherence to plastic. A similar phenomenon was observed after treatment with 800 x MIC chlorhexidine: 60% of the strains showed an increase in their adherence to ECM proteins, whereas 67% showed a decrease in adherence to plastic. Treatment of medical devices with at least 5000 mg/L of chlorhexidine or benzalkonium chloride could therefore reduce C. albicans adherence to plastic surfaces, but would be unable to prevent fungal adherence to ECM proteins.",
        "Medical devices used for on-target drug delivery are often coated with a hydrogel coating for friction-reduction purpose. Thus, the delivery of a sparingly-water-soluble drug by such a device must diffuse through a nonerodable hydrogel layer. An empirical rate equation has been derived for such a kinetic model and predicts that the rate of drug release from such a device is directly proportional to the loading of the drug in the polymeric matrix. The validity of this kinetic model was examined by measuring the rate of release of 2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl ether from different hydrogel-coated (ethylene-vinyl acetate) copolymer stents containing a wide range of the drug. The experimentally determined release rates are in reasonably good agreement with those calculated from the empirical rate equation. Bioefficacy test results based on zone-of-inhibition test against Escherichia coli are also in good agreement with the release rate and drug-loading data predicted according to the empirical rate equation.",
        "Throughout the developed world, economic evaluation of costly new pharmaceuticals and medical devices became increasingly widespread and systematic during the 1990s. However, serious concerns remain about the validity and relevance of this economic evidence, and about the transparency and accountability of its use in public sector reimbursement decisions. In this article, we summarise current concerns in Europe, based on interviews with European health economists from industry, universities, research institutes and consulting firms. We identify five challenges for European policy-makers, and conclude that there is considerable scope for improving decision-making without damaging incentives to innovate. The challenges are: (1). full publication of the economic evidence used in reimbursement decisions; (2). the redesign of licensing laws to improve the relevance of economic data available at product launch; (3). harmonisation of economic evaluation methodologies; (4). development of methodologies for evaluation of health inequality impacts; and (5). negotiation of price-performance deals to facilitate the use of economic evidence in post-launch pricing review decisions, as information is gathered from studies of product performance in routine use.",
        "The characteristics and capabilities of a light-scattering microemboli detector (LSMD) are delineated by detailing its state-of-the-art configuration, by discussing the theoretical and empirical aspects of instrument calibration, and by summarizing various experimental studies that have benefited from this instrument. In the past, thromboembolism, which often results when blood contacts medical devices, has eluded scientific scrutiny due to the absence of instruments that could detect and quantify thromboemboli in circulating blood. More recently, the ability of the LSMD to provide continuous, noninvasive detection of thromboemboli in whole blood (meaning that the LSMD probe does not contact the blood) was exploited in various in vitro and ex vivo models to explore thromboembolic phenomena. Through this work, the LSMD evolved as a sensitive and an economical research tool for the study of thromboembolic phenomena.",
        "The field of interest discussed in this study is a novel codification scheme for (vital signs) medical device communication and patient monitoring data interchange, into the context of effective home care service provisioning. With medical technology having developed in isolation and major manufacturers developing their own proprietary communication protocols, which preclude connection to devices from different manufacturers, and with healthcare trends having evolved, pointing to primary care, telecare and home care monitoring, there is an increasing need for technical standardization in healthcare environments and the development of protocols that enable communication in a structured and open way. In this study, a novel codification scheme has been developed, based on two healthcare informatics standards, the VITAL and DICOM Sup. 30, in addressing the robust interchange of waveform and medical data for a home care application. Based on this scheme, we created a real-time facility, consisting of a base unit and a telemedicine (mobile) unit, that enables home telemonitoring, by installing the telemedicine unit at the patient's home while the base unit remains at the physician's office or hospital. The system allows the transmission of vital biosignals (3-lead ECG, pulse rate, blood pressure and SpO2) of the patient. This paper presents an object-oriented design with unified modeling language (UML) of a class hierarchy for exchanging the acquired medical data and performing alert management, and investigates the applicability of the proposed scheme into a commercial patient-connected medical device, thus addressing service and functionality requirements with focus on home-care applications. The system has been validated for technical performance over several telecommunication means and for clinical validity via real patient-involved pilot trials.",

        "Bacterial colonisation of indwelling medical devices by coagulase-negative staphylococci is a prevalent risk in intensive-care units. Factors determining biofilm formation and progression to catheter- related infection are incompletely understood. We postulated that administration of inotropic agents via indwelling intravenous catheters may stimulate growth and formation of biofilms by Staphylococcus epidermidis.\nInocula representing physiologically relevant infecting doses of S epidermidis were incubated in a minimum medium supplemented with fresh human plasma in the presence or absence of pharmacological concentrations of norepinephrine or dobutamine. Biofilm formation on polystyrene and medical-grade silicone was examined. After incubation, cultures were assessed for growth and formation of biofilms by colony counting and scanning electronmicroscopy. The production of exopolysaccharide, a major constituent of S epidermidis biofilms, was also assessed by use of immunofluorescence microscopy.\nIncubation of S epidermidis with catecholamine inotropes in the presence of human plasma resulted in a significant increase in growth compared with control on both polystyrene and silicone surfaces, with pronounced increases in biofilm formation as visualised by scanning electronmicroscopy. Experiments with transferrin labelled with radioactive iron showed the ability of catecholamine inotropes to facilitate acquisition of iron by S epidermidis. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed extensive exopolysaccharide production associated with S epidermidis biofilms.\nThe ability of catecholamine inotropic drugs to stimulate bacterial proliferation and biofilm formation may be an aetiological factor in the development of intravascular catheter colonisation and catheter-related infection. The removal of iron from transferrin for subsequent use by S epidermidis is a possible mechanism by which catecholamine inotropes stimulate bacterial growth as biofilms.",
        "Endoscopes, including bronchoscopes, are the medical devices most frequently associated with outbreaks of nosocomial infections. We investigated an outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections after bronchoscopic procedures.\nMicrobiologic results were reviewed to determine the rates of recovery of P. aeruginosa from bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens. Environmental samples from endoscopes and the endoscopy suite were cultured. Medical records were reviewed to identify infections in the 14 days after a bronchoscopy.\nThe rate of recovery of P. aeruginosa from bronchoalveolar-lavage specimens obtained with use of endoscopy-suite bronchoscopes increased from 10.4 percent at base line to 31.0 percent during the outbreak (relative risk, 2.97; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.28 to 3.90). Cultures of samples from three bronchoscopes grew P. aeruginosa, whereas cultures of samples from the environment, instrument-cleaning machines, and gastrointestinal endoscopes did not. The three bronchoscopes had been part of a nationwide recall. A total of 414 patients underwent bronchoscopy during the outbreak, and there were 48 respiratory tract and bloodstream infections among 39 of these patients (9.4 percent). In 32 infections (66.7 percent), P. aeruginosa was confirmed as a potentially causative organism. Exposure to a potentially contaminated bronchoscope may have had a role in the death of three patients. The rate of recovery of P. aeruginosa returned to base line after the instruments were removed from service.\nThis large outbreak of P. aeruginosa infections related to bronchoscopy was apparently caused by a loose biopsy-port cap in the bronchoscopes. Instrument safety and surveillance methods for bronchoscopy must be improved, and better recall procedures are needed for medical devices.",

        "The approval process for some medical devices involves a single-arm trial in which the outcomes associated with the new device are compared to the expected outcomes associated with approved devices, the latter denoted the objective performance criterion (OPC). In this paper, models for multivariate mixed outcomes are applied to derive the OPC for a medical device to be used in clinical evaluations of the same type of device. We illustrate the techniques by determining the OPC for coronary artery stents, metal cages used to widen blocked coronary arteries in patients with coronary artery disease, using data from seven randomized trials of stents approved for use in the U.S.A. involving 5806 patients. The OPC is based on two 9-month endpoints: target lesion revascularization, a binary outcome, and proportion diameter stenosis, a continuous outcome. To account for the correlation between mixed outcomes we consider factorization of the likelihood into marginal and conditional components, or adoption of a latent variable model. Because the models have different structural forms, standard methods for model comparison (such as the AIC and BIC) cannot be used. We discuss how model identifiability and valid inference are achieved, and then adapt the deviance information criterion (DIC) and the pseudo-Bayes factor (PSBF) to select the best model. Nine months post-stenting, we find that the average posterior probability (standard deviation) of target lesion revascularization ranges from 0.086 (0.008) for non-diabetics with one diseased vessel to 0.163 (0.022) for diabetics with three diseased vessels. When considering proportion diameter stenosis, the corresponding posterior means are 0.375 (0.020) and 0.427 (0.030). The correlation coefficient of the components of the OPC lies in the range 0.042 to 0.116.",

        "Dental patients who have epilepsy with pharmacologically refractory seizures may be treated with an implanted pulse generator that electrically stimulates the left vagus nerve. The pulse generator functions like a cardiac pacemaker. Some electrical dental devices have been shown to cause electromagnetic interference with the function of cardiac pacemakers. The potential effect of similar dental equipment on vagus nerve stimulators is unknown.\nCommon electrical dental devices were operated at maximum power settings in close proximity to a representative vagus nerve stimulator. The author assessed any interference of the dental devices with the nerve stimulator function by observing oscilloscope tracings.\nUnder the conditions of this evaluation, none of the dental devices tested altered the function of the vagus nerve stimulator.\nSome commonly used electrical dental devices may be used in close proximity to patients who have implanted vagus nerve stimulators without adverse effects on the nerve stimulator function.\nDentists and dental hygienists may encounter patients with implanted vagus nerve stimulators, and they need to be cognizant of developments in the treatment of epilepsy. Under the conditions of this study, use of common dental electrical devices did not alter the function of a vagus nerve stimulator. The findings of this study, however, should not be generalized to all types of electrical dental or medical devices, as a recent report indicates that treatment with diathermy devices is contraindicated for patients with implanted nerve stimulators.",

        "We examined the differential benefits of instructional materials for younger and older adults learning to use a home medical device. Participants received training on use of a blood glucose meter via either a user manual (a text guide with pictures) or an instructional video. Performance was measured immediately and then after a 2-week retention interval. Type of instruction was critical for determining older adults' performance. Older adults trained using the manual had poorer performance than did all other groups. After only 1 calibration, older adults who received video training performed as accurately as did the younger adults. Older adults' performance was more influenced by the retention interval; however, the benefit of the video training was maintained for the older adults across the retention interval. Confidence ratings paralleled subjective workload ratings. The data provide practical information to guide the development of training programs for systems that will be used by both younger and older adults; they also demonstrate the need for age-related usability testing even for training program design.",
        "Nosocomial wound infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains have increasing importance in orthopaedic surgery. Outer membrane protein composition and cell-surface hydrophobicity of the bacteria have strong influence on adhesion to living tissues or artificial medical devices. Outer membrane proteins of five Pseudomonas strains (KT 2, KT 7, KT 25, KT 28, KT 39) isolated from orthopaedic patients' wounds and one standard strain NIH Hungary 170000 isolated from pus were examined. The capillary electrophoretic patterns of the outer membrane proteins were characteristic to each bacterial strains possessing different relative ratios of major and minor proteins. Antibiotic treatment of bacteria with three antibiotics, cefotaximum, amoxicillinum/clavulinic acid and amikacinum (applied often in prophylaxis and treatment of patients) induced changes in the electrophoretic profiles showing that outer membrane protein composition was altered significantly. The most pronounced alterations in the electrophoretic patterns after antibiotic treatment were obtained in the cases of the strains KT 2, KT 7 and KT 28. The amikacinum administration strongly decreased the relative percentage of the 38800 rel. mol. mass protein in KT 2 (from 20 to 6%). while the relative amount of the same protein increased significantly in KT 7 and KT 28 after cefotaximum treatment (from 2 to 16% and from 12 to 28%, respectively). Decrease in cell-surface hydrophobicity was also observed by salt aggregation test. The results obtained can be used to determine the therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics to induce changes in the adhesion properties of bacteria.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that it has issued an order in the form of a letter to Ethicon, Inc., reclassifying the absorbable polydioxanone surgical (PDS) suture intended for use in soft tissue approximation, including use in pediatric cardiovascular tissue where growth is expected to occur and ophthalmic surgery, from class III (premarket approval) to class II (special controls). Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, FDA is announcing the availability of the guidance document entitled \"Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Surgical Sutures; Guidance for Industry and FDA,\" which is immediately in effect as the special control for the PDS suture, but remains subject to public comment and possible future revision under the agency's good guidance practices. The agency is reclassifying this device into class II because new information supplied by the petitioner indicates that special controls, in addition to general controls, will provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device, and there is sufficient information to establish special controls. Accordingly, the order is being codified in the Code of Federal Regulations. Any firm submitting a premarket notification (510(k)) for a new PDS suture will need to address the issues covered in the special control guidance. However, the firm need only show that its device meets the recommendations of the guidance or in some other way provides equivalent assurances of safety and effectiveness.",
        "Single-use medical devices (SUDs, or disposables) have become a major expense in hospital budgets. The need for cost reduction and the availability of sterilization technologies other than the autoclave have prompted hospitals worldwide to begin reusing disposables, in many cases without proper assessment of the true costs (time, personnel, etc) and ease/difficulty of implementation of an institutional reuse program. Our group has developed a rigorous program model to evaluate SUDs for reuse. The program comprises 3 sequential protocols: (1) device audit, (2) laboratory evaluation, and (3) clinical evaluation. Use of this model can produce scientific and financial data sufficient for any institution interested in reuse to reach an initial decision about its feasibility. In addition to the testing outcomes, regulatory requirements, the position of manufacturers and third-party reprocessors, and legal and ethical concerns must be considered. A successful reuse program must include ongoing evaluations to ensure that the safety levels and cost savings established during the initial audit and evaluation phases continue. Herein, we give the rationale and details of our program model and discuss results of our pilot application of the \"ideal\" protocol in a real-world context.",

        "The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether enzyme-treated (ET)-NRL is less immunogenic than untreated NRL in a BALB/c mouse model of primary in vivo sensitization following repeated subcutaneous injections with the aqueous phase of ammoniated NRL or ET-NRL. Mice immunized with NRL produced IgE against NRL and ET-NRL, indicating that protease treatment did not completely destroy IgE antibody epitopes. In contrast, ET-NRL-immunized mice did not produce IgE against either NRL or ET-NRL, suggesting that enzyme treatment reduced the number of antigenic polypeptides associated with NRL below the threshold for sensitization. Thelper-lymphocytes from NRL-immunized mice proliferated and produced IL-4 when stimulated in vitro with polypeptides from NRL, but not ET-NRL. In contrast, Thelper-lymphocytes from ET-NRL-immunized mice were nonresponsive to ET-NRL or NRL. We conclude that lack of IgE production by ET-NRL-immunized mice is likely related to a lack of T-cell help in the form of IL-4, rather than enzyme digestion of IgE antibody epitopes. These data indicate that there is an immunologic rationale for production of enzyme-treated NRL-containing medical devices.",

        "When contract research organizations (CROs) were first formed, pharmaceutical companies outsourced to them only certain aspects of the conduct of their clinical trials. At first CROs were highly specialized entities, providing, for example, either biostatistical advice, clinical research associates who monitored investigational sites for regulatory compliance, or regulatory support. Gradually, full service CROs emerged, offering a full range of services for clinical trials, including the selection of investigators and investigational sites, assistance with patient recruitment, safety surveillance and reporting, site audits, and data management and biostatistics. This evolving relationship between CROs and the pharmaceutical and medical device industries has resulted in CROs assuming more and more of the regulatory and ethical risks and responsibilities inherent in the conduct of clinical trials. In this full service role, CROs, unlike sponsors, are not interested in the outcome of study, but like sponsors, are subject to heavy regulation by the federal government, must follow applicable state laws, must respect international guidelines, and are obliged to follow their own operating procedures. Moreover, they are judged by the industry on the basis of the scope and quality of services provided, including the degree of adherence to the research protocol, regulatory requirements, and timelines; the quality of the professional working relationships with investigators and institutions, both academic and community-based; and the validity of the data. Further, CROs are subject to comprehensive audits by sponsoring companies, FDA, and other regulatory authorities. For all these reasons, CROs are being tasked with strict vigilance of all stages of the clinical trial process to ensure that the laws, regulations, and industry standards designed for the protection of human subjects and data integrity are maintained.",
        "Current methods of analysis for ethylene oxide (EO) in medical devices include headspace and simulated-use extractions followed by gas chromatography with either a packed or a capillary column. The quantitation limits are about 0.5-1.0 microg/g for a packed column and about 0.1-0.2 microg/g for a capillary column. The current allowable levels of EO on medical devices sterilized with EO gas as outlined in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10993-7 may be significantly reduced from current levels by applying the ISO Draft International Standard 10993-17 method for establishing allowable limits. This may require EO test methods with detection and quantitation limits that are much lower than those of the currently available methods. This paper describes a new method that was developed for the determination of low-level EO by solid-phase microextraction using the direct-immersion method. Factors such as temperature and stirring were found to affect absorption efficiency and absorption time. A low extraction temperature (about 6 degrees C) was found to be more efficient than room-temperature extraction. Stirring was found to reduce absorption time by about 50%. Under these conditions, detection and quantitation limits of 0.002 and 0.009 microg/g, respectively, were obtained by using a capillary column. As a result, this method makes compliance with lower EO limits feasible.",

        "For over twenty-five years, Medicare has tried to promulgate a rule to implement the broad congressional directive to pay only for items and services that are \"reasonable and necessary.\" A rule would clarify legal authority and describe specific criteria for evaluation of new technology in Medicare. This case study is an intractable example of a larger issue of regula mortis or dead rule. Regula mortis occurs when a mobilized interest group blocks legitimate administrative agency action, causing a regulatory stalemate. In this case, the medical device industry has prevented the implementation of a rule. The article diagnoses the condition of regula mortis, explains its effects in the Medicare case, and draws on principles of administrative law to propose remedies to break the logjam. While the case of coverage criteria is important in its own right, it has wider relevance. All health systems must grapple with the challenge of evaluating new technologies. Medicare efforts provide a starting point for the policy discussion. In our current political environment, regula mortis may be an increasingly common phenomenon and the proposed cures for it broadly applicable.",

A head model with an implanted deep brain stimulation electrode (DBS) was exposed to a continuous RF-field similar to the excitational field used in MRI at a frequency of 64 MHz. In this study a two-step procedure for the accurate estimation of electrode-heating during MRI is presented. First the energy loss was calculated in the frequency domain during an applied RF-pulse. Then a thermodynamic algorithm taking heat transfer mechanisms into account was used. The applied method showed to be numerically stable and gave more accurate results than first calculated using a simple worst-case approximation.",

In response to the need for reducing medication errors, the National Coordinating Council for Medication Errors Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) released the NCC MERP taxonomy that provides a standard language for reporting medication errors. This project maps the NCC MERP taxonomy of medication error to MedWatch medical errors involving infusion pumps. Of particular interest are human factors associated with medical device errors.

Because dilution, evaporation, and breakdown or neutralization of active ingredients can occur during reuse, it is vital to ensure that the solution retains its broad-spectrum germicidal activity even at the end of the recommended reuse period.\nThe purpose of this study was to combine the US Environmental Protection Agency's and the Food and Drug Administration's recommended simulated reuse method with recently developed quantitative carrier tests (QCT) to assess the broad-spectrum germicidal activity of a 7% solution of accelerated hydrogen peroxide (pH 2.9) stressed for 14 days.\nOn alternate days baths with 3 lots of the test formulation were stressed by the addition of bacteria (Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) on glass beads and spores (Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium sporogenes ) on metallic penicylinders. In addition, one set of respiratory therapy equipment was subjected to 3 daily cycles of disinfection in each bath. The pH and H(2)O(2) levels in the test samples were measured, and they were also subjected to QCTs for their sporicidal, bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal, and mycobactericidal activities.\nAfter 14 days of reuse, the pH of the test solutions remained essentially unchanged. Although the level of H(2)O(2) dropped from a high of 7.66% to as low as 6.40%, all lots showed the required level of broad-spectrum germicidal activity after 14 days of stress.\nThe stress test and QCT were successfully combined in demonstrating the broad-spectrum germicidal activity of a high-level disinfectant subjected to 14 days of simulated reuse.",
        "Because bacterial colonization of medical devices may result in clinical infection, it is conceivable that antimicrobial impregnation of tissue expanders may reduce the rate of infection. The objective of this in vitro study was to examine the spectrum, durability, and shelf-life antimicrobial activity of minocycline/rifampin-impregnated silicone tissue expander shells. The impregnated devices exhibited zones of inhibition at baseline against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The impregnated devices exhibited strong residual activity against S. epidermidis and S. aureus after suspension in serum at 37 degrees C for 4 weeks. There was no significant decrease in the size of zones of inhibition after storing the impregnated devices at room temperature for 1 year. These results indicate that minocycline/rifampin-impregnated tissue expander shells provide broad-spectrum and durable antimicrobial activity and that the shelf-life antimicrobial activity exceeds 1 year. These findings prompt future exploration of the anti-infective efficacy of these antimicrobial-impregnated devices.",

Although it commonly is assumed that such clinical trials were developed in the 1930s, the first published report that used intentional subject ignorance and sham intervention was the result of a 1784 French royal commission investigation into mesmerism, headed by Benjamin Franklin. The strategy the Franklin commission used to debunk Franz Mesmer's assertions about health and illness served as a model for subsequent inquiries that use placebo controls and blinded assessment to arrive at their conclusions.",
        "Close control of blood glucose levels significantly reduces vascular complications in Type I diabetes. A control method for the automation of insulin infusion that utilizes emerging technologies in blood glucose biosensors is presented. The controller developed provides tighter, more optimal control of blood glucose levels, while accounting for variation in patient response, insulin employed and sensor bandwidth. Particular emphasis is placed on controller simplicity and robustness necessary for medical devices and implants.A PD controller with heavy emphasis on the derivative term is found to outperform the typically used proportional-weighted controllers in glucose tolerance and multi-meal tests. Simulation results show reductions of over 50% in the magnitude and duration of blood glucose excursions from basal levels. A closed-form steady state optimal solution is also developed as a benchmark, and results in a flat glucose response. The impact and trade-offs associated with sensor bandwidth, sensor lag and proportional versus derivative-based control methods are illustrated. Overall, emerging blood glucose sensor technologies that enable frequent measurement are shown to enable more effective, automated control of blood glucose levels within a tight, acceptable range for Type I and II diabetic individuals.",
        "In response to attachment to a surface, fungal cells produce biofilms, three-dimensional structures composed of cells surrounded by exopolymeric matrices. Surface attachment causes Candida albicans cells to enter a special physiological state in which they are highly resistant to antifungal drugs and express the drug efflux determinants CDR1, CDR2 and MDR1. C. albicans biofilms produced under different conditions differ in their cellular morphology and matrix content, which suggests that biofilms formed within a host, for example on indwelling medical devices, would also differ depending on the nature of the device and its location. The mechanisms by which surface attachment leads to biofilm formation are presently not understood.",

Both DMSO and Ham's F12 cell culture medium extracts according to ISO 10993-12 (Biological evaluation of medical devices-Part 12: sample preparation and reference materials, Geneva, Switzerland) exhibit a clear genotoxic effect in the umu-test. The effect is independent of the extraction volume in a range from 0.5 to 4 ml Ham's F12 cell culture medium. Subsequent extractions of Vitrebond showed no significant difference in the genotoxic response although weight loss and content of 2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate dropped significantly. In vivo conditions of Vitrebond were simulated by extractions with artificial and collected human saliva. These extracts showed a clear genotoxic effect in the umu-test, even if only a few seconds of extraction time were applied. In conclusion, sample preparations for genotoxicity testing according to ISO 10993-12 reflect the in vivo conditions of Vitrebond applications. This seems to be mostly due to the hydrophilic nature of the genotoxic ingredients.",

A 7-year-old girl with p-ANCA-positive crescentic glomerulonephritis, treated with peritoneal dialysis, developed peritonitis due to Leuconostoc species. She had a history of treatment with vancomycin and a brief course of immunosuppressive therapy. The peritonitis responded well to ampicillin therapy. To date, only 47 cases of Leuconostoc infection, including our patient, have been reported in the medical literature; 25 of the cases occurred in children. Only 1 prior case has been reported in the setting of peritoneal dialysis. The risk factors for Leuconostoc infections are not clear, but commonly associated conditions include immunocompromised status and indwelling medical devices. Leuconostoc species are easily misidentified as streptococci in culture, but they possess inherent resistance to vancomycin despite sensitivity to most other antibiotics. In patients with gram-positive peritonitis, Leuconostoc should be considered as a possible etiological agent, particularly if vancomycin resistance is noted in an organism thought to be a Streptococcus species.",

The consumption of a single antimicrobial agent was expressed as daily defined doses (DDD) per 100 bed days. In 1999 drugs accounted for 56% of the total costs but decreased to 46% in 2000. Antibiotics accounted for 15% of the pharmacy's overall acquisition costs in 1999 and dropped to 13% in 2000. In both 1999 and 2000, penicillins were used most, followed by cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. In 1999, the most frequently used antibiotic was amoxicillin (4.02 DDD per 100 bed days) followed by ceftazidime, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and co-amoxiclav. In 2000 ceftriaxone was the most commonly used antibiotic (4.35 DDD per 100 bed days) followed by co-amoxiclav, amoxicillin, ceftazidime. The general surgery, medical therapy and infectious diseases units accounted for the majority of penicillin consumption, while cephalosporins were most widely used in general surgery, orthopedics and neurosurgery units. Parenteral administration was the most widely used route in both years.",
        "The use of syringe drivers as a method of drug delivery to control symptoms in palliative care is a common and accepted practice, but one which has evolved rather than been subject to close multiprofessional scrutiny and guideline formation. There is evidence that adverse incidents may arise as a result of syringe driver use (Medical Devices Agency (MDA), 1998), for example, errors in drug calculations, drug stability, equipment failure (including disconnection) and the wrong rate of infusion. Inadequate user training, poor servicing of equipment and inadequate documentation and record keeping are all thought to be contributing factors (MDA, 1998). In the hospital where this audit was carried out, syringe drivers are used to administer drugs to patients with cancer during the palliative phase of illness. The purpose of this clinical audit was to establish the standard of current practice in wards where syringe drivers were being used. A retrospective study of 13 cases of syringe driver use is presented. The results highlight many areas of unregulated practice with regard to setting up, monitoring and maintenance of syringe drivers. The choice of drugs and doses prescribed, evaluation of treatment responses and review of treatment regimens were also areas of concern. Guidelines for the use of syringe drivers in non-specialist hospitals are put forward.",

In addition, it describes changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services paid under the prospective payment system. These changes are applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2003. This rule also allows the Secretary to suspend Medicare payments \"in whole or in part\" if a provider fails to file a timely and acceptable cost report. In addition, this rule responds to public comments received on the November 2, 2001 interim final rule with comment period (66 FR 55850) that set forth the criteria the Secretary will use to establish new categories of medical devices eligible for transitional pass-through payment under the Medicare's hospital outpatient prospective payment system.

        "Thin metallic wires with an adherent hydrophilic/ lubricious polymeric coating were manufactured in a new extrusion-like procedure. This procedure is part of a novel and efficient way of assembling lubricious guide wires for intravascular interventions, such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. It is reported that heparin can readily be incorporated in the hydrophilic coating. A set of heparin-containing guidewire models was made and studied in detail. This showed that (i). immersion of the guide-wire models in an aqueous environment leads to release of heparin from their surface; (ii). the presence of heparin in the coating does not impede the lubricity of the coils; (iii). addition of stearic acid in the coating, next to heparin, does not influence the lubricity of the guide-wire models. Two different charges of heparin (designated heparin-low and heparin-high) were incorporated in the coating. It is discussed that release of heparin from the surface of medical devices (e.g. guide wires and catheters) is much more effective than systemic heparinization, basically because dissolved heparin molecules have a much larger probability of simply passing a medical device's surface (axial convection) rather than contacting it (radial diffusion).",
        "Modification of biomaterial surfaces is one approach aimed at improving cellular interactions and the subsequent integration of medical devices into the body. However, by optimising surfaces to enhance mammalian cell adhesion there is the potential risk that adhesion of bacteria will also be increased. Bacterial colonisation of biomaterials can be problematic as infection often results in morbidity and the consequent removal of the failing device from the body. Currently, quantifying cellular adhesion from a mixed population of bacterial and mammalian cells can only be determined by slow and laborious methods such as microscopy. ATP is a key molecule in the metabolism of both mammalian and bacterial cells and can be used to quantify cell numbers. In this study, we have modified a bioluminescence-based ATP assay to enable the differential measurement of both mammalian and bacterial cell ATP levels within the same culture. Mixed populations of Staphylococcus epidermidis and 3T3 fibroblasts were assessed both in suspension and adhered to a surface. ATP levels from cultures in suspension were selectively extracted and measured from both cell types, revealing a linear trend that would enable the differentiation of cell numbers from a mixed population. The application of the assay to adhered mixed cultures also allowed differences in ATP levels from both cell types to be distinguished. The data presented reveals that this assay would be useful for the rapid screening of cellular adhesion to modified surfaces although, its use in detecting subtle differences in ATP levels may be limited due to natural interactions between the two cell types.",

        "Diazeniumdiolates, compounds of structure R(1)R(2)NN(O)=NOR(3), which have also been called NONOates, have proven useful for treating an increasing diversity of medical disorders in relevant animal models. Here, I review the chemical features that make them such excellent starting points for designing materials capable of targeting reliable and controllable fluxes of bioactive NO for in vitro and in vivo applications. This is followed by a consideration of recent proof-of-concept studies that underscore what I believe to be the substantial clinical promise of such materials. Examples covered include progress toward inhibiting restenosis after angioplasty, preparing thromboresistant medical devices, reversing vasospasm, and relieving pulmonary hypertension. Together with a very recent report describing the beneficial effects of diazeniumdiolate therapy in a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome, the results of the animal experiments support the prediction that a broad selection of problems in clinical medicine can be solved by judiciously mining the enormous variety of possible R(1)R(2)NN(O)=NOR(3) structures.",
        "We present a Bayesian approach to determining the optimal sample size for a historically controlled clinical trial. This work is motivated by a trial of a new coronary stent that uses a retrospective control group formed from seven trials of coronary stents currently marketed in the United States. In studies involving nonrandomized control groups, hierarchical regression, propensity score methods, or other sophisticated models are typically required to account for heterogeneity among groups which, if ignored could bias the results. Sample size calculations for historically controlled trials of medical devices are often based on formulae derived for randomized trials and fail to account for estimation of model parameters, correlation of observations, and uncertainty in the distribution of covariates of the patients recruited in the new trial. We propose methodology based on stochastic optimization that overcomes these deficiencies. The methodology is demonstrated using an objective function based on the power of the trial from a Bayesian approach. Analytic approximations based on a covariate-free analysis that convey features of the power function are developed. Our principle conclusions are that exact sample size calculations can be substantially different from current approximations, and stochastic optimization provides a convenient method of computation.",
        "Due to its ability to attach to polymeric surfaces Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common pathogen in chronic, medical device-associated infections. Attached S. epidermidis displays reduced susceptibility against a variety of antimicrobial substances, and little correlation between standard susceptibility test results and clinical outcome of antibiotic treatment is observed. In this study we established a new, versatile, and easy method of antimicrobial susceptibility testing for attached Staphylococcus epidermidis, suitable for both biofilm-negative and biofilm-positive attached bacteria using readily available equipment. For three biofilm-positive wild-type strains and their biofilm-negative mutants minimal attachment killing concentrations (MAK) of penicillin, oxacillin, vancomycin, and gentamicin were determined. Depending on strain and investigated antibiotics, a heterogeneous MAK (MAK(hetero)) could be differentiated from a homogeneous resistance (MAK(homo)), favoring a model of few persisters within attached cells under antibiotic treatment. For the biofilm-negative mutants, a lower MAK(homo) was detected than for the corresponding wild types for some of the tested antibiotics, which probably resulted from higher bacterial inocula of wild-type strains, whereas the MAK(hetero) were comparable for mutants and wild types for most of the tested antibiotics and strains. These data indicate that biofilm formation is not a necessary prerequisite for persistence of attached S. epidermidis cells under antibiotic treatment, which could explain therapeutic failure in foreign body-associated infections due to biofilm-negative S. epidermidis isolates. The highly individual resistance phenotypes of the investigated strains with different antibiotics suggests that MAK determination could help to predict the therapeutic outcome of foreign body-associated infections with both biofilm-positive and biofilm-negative S. epidermidis.",
        "MISTI Gold breast implants (Bioplasty, St. Paul, Minn.) filled with polyvinylpyrrolidone-hydrogel were developed as a promising alternative to silicone-filled implants. Some studies have reported on the positive effects of the implant, such as improved radiolucency and biocompatibility of the gel; however, there are also reports that such implants increased in volume and were subject to capsular contracture in the human body, resulting in demands for their removal. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the long-term results of a series of patients with MISTI Gold breast implants. Between 1991 and 1993, the authors inserted 83 MISTI Gold implants in 61 patients with an average age of 46 years (range, 16 to 69). The authors were able to follow up 48 patients with 71 MISTI Gold implants. The average follow-up was 68 months (range, 10 to 108 months). The retrospective study found that 59 percent of all MISTI Gold implants were removed after an average period of 4.14 years. The main reason for implant removal was an increase in volume of 38 percent, followed by capsular contracture in 14 percent of all 71 MISTI Gold implants. The average increase in volume of all removed MISTI Gold implants was 43 percent. Capsular contracture was graded as Baker I and II in 63 percent and as Baker III and IV in 37 percent. In conclusion, the authors believe that MISTI Gold implants do not fulfill the criteria of safe breast implants, and they agree with the December of 2000 opinion of the Medical Devices Agency of the Department of Health in London that the hydrogel-filled breast implants should not be used until more information about the filler material and its metabolic fate is available.",
        "The use of ethylene oxide as a sterilizing agent has been frequently practiced, especially taking into account the huge variety of medical devices produced with heat sensitive materials. Mixtures of ethylene oxide and inert gases have been widely adopted in order to decrease the undesirable flammable and explosive properties of ethylene oxide. This article provides a study regarding the sterilizing effectiveness of two ethylene oxide blends: Oxyfume 2002R (using HCFCs 22 and 124) and Oxyfume 12R (using CFC 12), at different temperatures (45, 55, and 65 degrees C). To accomplish this procedure, sub-lethal challenges were performed (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 minutes) using biological indicators (obtained in the laboratory) made of Bacillus subtilis var. niger ATCC 9372. The sterilizing efficacy of both mixtures was equivalent at the gas concentration of 600 mg/L. The influence of higher temperatures was thus proved.",
        "Ethylene oxide (ETO) is presently the most commonly used sterilization method for medical devices. Although alternative sterilization modes such as steam sterilization have been suggested, the effect of steam on dialysis-induced cytokine release is unknown. We enrolled 9 patients on chronic hemodialysis and evaluated at different intervals IL-1beta production while treated with ETO (NC 1785-Bellco) and steam sterilized NC 1785S-Bellco) Synthetically Modified Cellulose (SMC). A basal test during treatment with NC 1785 was performed (A); the same test was set up 4 weeks after treatment with NC 1785S (B) and, lastly, 4 weeks after returning to NC 1785 (C). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were purified before and after the dialysis session, were isolated on a Ficoll/Hypaque gradient and incubated for 24 h. Spontaneous IL-1beta release was evaluated in the supernatant and in the lysate. In A, IL-1beta levels were (in pg/ml/10(6) cells, in supematant and lysate, respectively): 5.8 +/- 4.8 and 7.6+/-5.2 in pre-HD and 4.68 +/- 3.6 and 9.7 +/- 6.65 in post-HD. These levels showed a clear reduction in B: 2.5 +/- 2.2 and 4.4 +/- 3.1 in pre-HD, and 4.35+/- 6.6 and 7.52 +/- 7.22 in post-HD. In the C test, 4 weeks after the return to the ETO membrane, IL-1beta levels remained unchanged: 2.9 +/- 1.8 and 4.5 +/- 3.1 in pre-HD; and 2.6 +/- 3 and 5.7 +/- 6.6 in post-HD. Statistical analysis showed significant changes in the pre-HD levels both in supematant (p < 0.04) and in lysate (p < 0.04). Steam sterilization of SMC induced a lower spontaneous IL-1beta release, but this effect was not statistically significant due to the large inter-individual variation. Hence, contrary to claims of better biocompatibility, steam sterilization does not result in a reduced production of pro-inflammatory IL-1beta.",

        "Measurement of ecological, climatic and anthropogenic changes underpins the formulation of effective management strategies for sustainable use and protection of the marine environment. Sensors are traditionally used in marine studies to determine physical parameters, but there is increasing demand for real-time information about chemical and biological parameters. These parameters are currently measured in samples collected at sea and subsequently analysed in the laboratory. Biosensors fuse the exquisite sensitivity and specificity of living systems with the processing power of microelectronics to deliver simple, inexpensive measurement systems for use in the field or deployment in situ. While their potential for use in the marine environment is enormous, much published work to date has focussed on applications in freshwater and wastewater. Marine applications pose a substantial challenge in the robustness required for remote application, but recent developments in portable medical devices and receptor design suggest that these demands can now be realistically tackled.",

Work place investigations included descriptions of the work environment and physical measurements. We estimated electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields by spot measurements in air, by logged exposure data, and when possible, we recorded induced currents in limbs. The instruments used were Wandel and Golterman EFA-3, NARDA 8718, Holaday HI-3702. The exposure sources comprised five induction furnaces, seven induction heaters, one surface treatment equipment, four units of electronic article surveillance (EAS), and medical devices for surgery and muscle stimulation. The induction furnaces operated at 480 Hz-7 kHz, and the maximum values of logged data varied between 512-2,093 V/m (E field) and 10.5-87.3 A/m (H field). The induction heaters (3.8 kHz-1.25 MHz) also showed high maximum exposure values of both E and H fields. Three EAS units, an electromagnetic plate at a library, a luggage control unit, and an antitheft gate, showed E fields reaching 658-1,069 V/m. The H fields were comparatively lower, except for the antitheft gate (5 and 7.5 kHz) showing a maximum value of 27.2 A/m (recorded during repair). Induced currents of 5-13 mA were measured for the medical devices. The study improves the basis for an exposure assessment for epidemiological studies of long term effects of exposures to high frequency electromagnetic fields.",

The Bureau has carried out a laboratory investigation to determine the effect of missing capacitors on the energy delivered by the defibrillator and to assess whether these capacitor failures represent a significant risk to patients. Our findings indicate that the automated external defibrillator will not perform acceptably with two broken capacitors. They further suggest that, during preventive maintenance, operators should use a defibrillator analyser to measure the delivered energy output rather than using the internal energy measurement circuit within the automated external defibrillator.",

Hospitalized patients may be exposed to high concentrations of plasticizers, antioxidants, and chemical contaminants in PVC medical devices during blood transfusion or hemodialysis, thus, making them vulnerable to more potentially adverse effects of these chemicals than healthy people. At the same time, recently, the effect of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on hospitalized patients has attracted a great deal of attention. This study aims to investigate the harmful effects of estrogenic compounds in medical PVC tubing by two approaches of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and estrogen receptor (ER) binding assay.\nResidual plasticizers, antioxidants, and chemical contaminants in PVC tubing were subjected to GC-MS in the full-scan mode with an original library for plastic additives. Such residual compounds in PVC tubing were screened at very low concentrations (10(-2)-10(5) nmol/l) to determine whether they competed with fluorescein-labeled estradiol for ER (alpha).\nDEHP, 2-ethylhexanol, butylated hydroxytoluene, and 4-nonylphenol (NP) were detected in medical PVC tubing. In addition, only NP in PVC tubing was found to bind with ER.\nThe current study proves that the main residual chemical for estrogenic effect was NP in medical PVC tubing.",
        "Enteric and respiratory viruses are among the most frequent causes of human infections, and hands play an important role in the spread of these and many other viral diseases. Regular and proper hand hygiene by caregivers and food handlers in particular is essential to decontaminate hands and potentially interrupt such spread. What would be considered a proper decontamination of hands? Handwashing with regular soap and water is often considered sufficient, but what of hygienic handwash and handrub antiseptic products? Are they more effective? The evidence suggests that some clearly are. Activity against bacteria may not reflect the ability of hygienic hand antiseptics to deal with viruses, especially those that are nonenveloped. In spite of the acknowledged importance of hands as vehicles for viruses, there is a lack of suitable regulatory mechanism for handwash or handrub products to make claims of efficacy against viruses. This is in contrast with the ability of general-purpose disinfectants to make antiviral claims, although transmission of viruses from surfaces other than those of reusable medical devices may play only a minor role in virus transmission. This review discusses the (1). recent information on the relative importance of viruses as human pathogens, particularly those causing enteric and respiratory infections; (2). the survival of relevant viruses on human hands in comparison with common gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria; (3). the potential of hands to transfer or receive such contamination on casual contact; (4). role of hands in the spread of viruses; (5). the potential of hygienic measures to eliminate viruses from contaminated hands; (6). relative merits of available protocols to assess the activity of hygienic hand antiseptics against viruses; and (7). factors considered crucial in any tests to assess the activity of hygienic hand antiseptics against viruses. In addition, this review proposes surrogate viruses in such testing and discusses issues for additional consideration by researchers, manufacturers, end-users, and regulators.",
        "How do active implantable medical devices react in the presence of strong magnetic fields in the frequency range between extremely low frequency (ELF) to radiofrequency (RF) as they are emitted by electronic security systems (ESS)? There are three different sorts of ESSs: electronic article surveillance (EAS) devices, metal detector (MDS) devices, and radiofrequency identification (RFID) systems. Common to all is the production of magnetic fields. There is an abundance of literature concerning interference by ESS gates with respect to if there is an influence possible and if such an influence can bear a risk for the AIMD wearers. However, there has been no attempt to study the physical mechanism nor to develop a model of how and under which conditions magnetic fields can influence pacemakers and defibrillators and how they could be disarmed by technological means. It is too often assumed that interference of AIMD with ESS is inevitable. Exogenous signals of similar intensity and rhythm to heart signals can be misinterpreted and, thus, confuse the implant. Important for the interference coupling mechanism is the differentiation between a \"unipolar\" and a \"bipolar\" system. With respect to magnetic fields, the left side implanted pacemaker is the most unfavorable case as the lead forms approximately a semicircular area of maximum 225 cm2 into which a voltage can be induced. This assumption yields an interference coupling model that can be expressed by simple mathematics. The worst-case conditions for induced interference voltages are a coupling area of 225 cm2 that is representative for a large human, a homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the area formed by the lead, and a unipolar ventricular pacemaker system that is implanted on the left side of the thorax and has the highest interference sensitivity. In bipolar systems the fields must be 17 times larger when compared to a unipolar system to have the same effect. The magnetic field for interfering with ICDs must be 1.7 stronger than that of the most sensitive unipolar pacemaker. The lowest interference thresholds measured over the last 10 years in the low frequency range (16 2/3 Hz-24 kHz) together with thresholds > 24 kHz that were supplied by the CETECOM study are listed. Both sets of data together with the coupling model, allow for judging which fields of ESSs could influence AIMDs. From measurements at gate antennas, it is possible to derive a \"maximum allowed field\" curve over the whole frequency range, below which no interference will occur. Comparison of data from literature with these maximum allowed fields confirm the correctness of the calculations. Thus, it is possible to predict interference situations in gates if the magnetic field is known. If all future pacemakers were to have the immunity against interference of the better 50% of today's pacemakers, the magnetic field ceiling values could be at least four times higher. The same is true if the ventricular sensitivity is routinely set at 7 mV. Pacemaker manufacturers should consider filter improvement with modern technology, but gate manufacturers should not claim the privilege of being out of bounds.",
        "Physicians in community-based practice rarely have the time, nor the inclination, to participate in formal, controlled clinical research. While few would question the importance of statistically valid clinical trials focused on establishing the safety and efficacy of new pharmaceuticals and medical devices, most busy practitioners recognize that formal clinical research can't be approached casually. Beyond the operational infrastructure typically required to execute medical research, the imposition of fundamentally experimental research is such that it is not easily accommodated in day-to-day medical practice. Indeed, the often artificial nature of controlled clinical research is, in many ways, incompatible with actual practice conditions. However, the characteristics and, more importantly, the outcomes of \"real world\" medical practice are becoming of increasing scientific and practical importance. Underscored by recent post-approval drug recalls, the \"real world\" practice environment can be an invaluable source of information on the actual effectiveness of treatment regimens, drugs, and devices. Inasmuch as clinical trials tend to exclude noncompliant patients and those with comorbid conditions, a new paradigm is appropriate for capturing the outcomes of actual practice. While not without statistical and analytical limitation, the brand of \"naturalistic\" research undertaken in observational patient registries is becoming rapidly accepted by both the scientific and practitioner communities.",
        "Since the introduction of the randomized clinical trial (RCT) over 50 years ago, this method has become the corner stone for evaluating new pharmacologic or biologic agents with many disease areas benefiting. There are numerous examples demonstrating beneficial interventions as well as others either not beneficial or harmful. Statistical methodology for clinical trials has grown rapidly. Advances in information technology for data collection have allowed trials to be conducted around the world. Academia, industry and government have worked in partnership to conduct RCTs. Despite these many RCT achievements, the most interesting and challenging era of clinical trials lies ahead of us. With the human genome now sequenced, we face a new set of challenges to transform vast amounts of data into useful information. The post-genomics era will better identify the disease mechanism and thus help design better treatments, and be more selective in screening patients, yielding more efficient clinical trials. For some areas of medicine, such as medical devices, standards of acceptance and regulatory approval are changing. Other areas, such as medical procedures and alternative medicines, are generally not well evaluated and could benefit greatly from a wider use of RCT methodology. As the ICH guidelines facilitate and encourage international clinical trials, the scientific and ethical dimension of conducting trials in Third World countries are raised. For example, Western society's best standard of care may not be available or affordable to these countries as the control Western investigators should not exploit patients in the Third World. Those and many other challenges face us in the decade ahead. It is truly an exciting time with new opportunities for the RCT to contribute to medicine and health care or prevention.",
        "The formation and properties of electrochemical platinum films grown on platinum contacts contained in implantable flexible microelectrodes were investigated. The resulting platinum deposits were obtained by applying cyclic voltammetry to baths containing concentrations around 70 mM of chloroplatinic acid. A pre-activation step was necessary before the platinum-electroplating step in order to achieve good adhesive properties. The benefits of this process were ascribed to higher corrosion resistance, lower impedance and improved adhesion to the sputtered platinum. These improvements can make the application of this electrochemical technique highly useful for increasing the lifetime of implantable microelectrode arrays, such as cuff structures (IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 40 (1993) 640). These medical devices, obtained by semiconductor technology could be used for selective stimulation of nerve fascicles, although, poor long-term performance has been achieved with them. The dissolution rate for platinum thin-film microelectrodes under fixed corrosion test conditions was 38.8 ng/C. Lower rates were observed for electroplated microelectrodes, obtaining a dissolution rate of 7.8 ng/C under analogous experimental ageing conditions. The corrosion behaviour of the electroplated platinum during stimulation experimental conditions was estimated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.",

Little is known about the characteristics or outcomes of patients who are determined by physicians to no longer be eligible for hospice care. This retrospective study was designed to characterize the rates and predictors of live hospice discharge using data from the 1996 and 1998. National Home and Hospice Care Survey (NHHCS). We compare records of live hospice discharge with hospice discharges due to death from the discharge patient files of the 1996 and the 1998 NHHCS. Of the 807,733 patients in the combined 1996 and 1998 NHHCS discharge patient file who met study inclusion criteria, 761,858 (94 percent) were deceased and 45,875 (6 percent) were discharged alive. Those who were discharged alive were more likely to be female, have received hospice care for more than 60 days, and to have had a noncancer diagnosis, particularly advanced cardiopulmonary or neurologic disease. Mean age and total number of assistive medical devices used did not differ significantly between patients who were discharged alive and those who died in hospice care. Factors most associated with live hospice discharge, using bivariate analyses, were length of service greater than 60 days (OR, 6.60; 95 percent CI, 6.47-6.73), cardiopulmonary diagnosis (OR, 3.24; 95 percent CI, 3.19-3.30), and neurologic diagnosis (OR, 2.73; 95 percent CI, 2.67-2.79). Multivariate logistic regression identified length of service greater than 60 days, cardiopulmonary diagnosis, neurologic diagnosis, female gender, worse functional status, and living in an institutional setting as being independently associated with live hospice discharge. We found that patients who were discharged alive from hospice care were more likely to have longer lengths of service, noncancer diagnoses, and better functional status than those who died while receiving hospice care. Age was not associated with discharge disposition. Given the demonstrated differences between these patients and those who died while receiving hospice care, these data provide further impetus for careful study of the appropriateness of current hospice eligibility criteria, the determinants of hospice discharge and, most important, the outcomes of patients who are discharged alive from hospice and the impact of hospice discharge on patients and their families.",

The scientific program started with an overview of efforts directed toward promoting international collaboration in natural product-derived anticancer drug discovery. This was followed by a discussion on the importance of interethnic differences and pharmacogenetics in anticancer drug development. Thereafter, this part of the program was completed by a description of the activities of the newly created Singapore-Hong Kong-Australia Drug Development Consortium and an overview of the contribution of Japan to anticancer drug development. The logistics and regulatory aspects of clinical trials with new anticancer agents in different parts of the world were then presented, with an emphasis on Europe, North America, and Japan. The program was completed with a panel discussion of the efforts to harmonize the exchange of clinical data originating from one region of the globe with other territories, with input from official representatives of the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Medical Devices Evaluation Center of Japan.",
        "In response to new demands for infant walking orthoses consideration was given to the development of a device for this category of patient. A specially developed hip joint with the required structural properties (Woollam et al., 2001) provided an opportunity for this development. Earlier structural assessment, and limited cyclic load testing of key elements of the orthosis (primarily the body brace), confirmed that a safe device for evaluation with patients could, theoretically, be produced. A provisional prototype was therefore designed and manufactured for initial structural testing of the complete infant orthosis (Stallard et al., 2001). Efficiency of walking is strongly influenced by the lateral rigidity of the orthosis. Monitoring the structural performance of the provisional infant design indicated it would equal or improve on the stiffness of that achieved in the adult specification. Additionally, relative strength was comparable with the adult version, which has proven to be safe and reliable in many years of routine prescription. This, together with the limited cyclic testing of the complete orthosis (Stallard et al., 2001), gave confidence that it was safe to proceed with controlled field evaluation of the infant design when supplied as a rehabilitation engineering device within the provisions of an ISO9001 and EN46001 QA System. This additional study of controlled patient use, and further representative cyclic load testing in parallel with the field evaluation, had established the long-term structural safety of the orthosis. Wider application is now to be introduced through completion of the EC (European Community) Medical Devices Directive formalities.",

        "Biofouling is referred to as the unwanted deposition and growth of biofilms. This phenomenon can occur in an extremely wide range of situations, from the colonisation of medical devices to the production of ultra-pure, drinking and process water and the fouling of ship hulls, pipelines and reservoirs. Although biofouling occurs in such different areas, it has a common cause, which is the biofilm. Biofilms are the most successful form of life on Earth and tolerate high amounts of biocides. For a sustainable anti-fouling strategy, an integrated approach is suggested which includes the analysis of the fouling situation, a selection of suitable components from the anti-fouling menu and an effective and representative monitoring of biofilm development.",
        "Antibiotic resistance is a consequence of antibiotic use - we need to use antibiotics less and to use them prudently. Plans to combat antibiotic resistance were recently proposed by the World Health Organization, a United States interagency taskforce and the Australian Joint Expert Technical Advisory Committee on Antibiotic Resistance. Prudent antibiotic use includes not using antibiotics when benefit is minimal (eg, in many respiratory tract infections), using narrow-spectrum antibiotics whenever possible and using optimal dosages and regimens. The need for antibiotic therapy can be reduced by preventing infections through vaccination, infection control measures and improved sanitation. Surveillance of antibiotic resistance is needed to target interventions for minimising antibiotic use. More research is needed into new antibiotics and regimens and into improving medical devices and protocols to prevent infection. Some simple changes to practice could reduce development and spread of antibiotic resistance",
        "To develop a thermoplastic elastomer with high blood compatibility, a 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) polymer was blended with the segmented polyurethane (SPU) for preparing the polymer alloy. A tensile strength measurement was carried out to evaluate its mechanical strength. The mechanical strength of the SPU/MPC polymer alloy is the same as that of the original SPU and sufficient for use in medical applications. The thermal properties of the polymer alloy were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC curves indicated that the MPC polymer blended into the SPU did not affect the hard segment domain of the SPU. The SPU/MPC polymer alloy can be processed by heat treatment at 150 degrees C. Even after heat treatment, the SPU/MPC polymer alloy showed good mechanical properties, and MPC units were observed on the surface. Protein adsorption from human plasma was observed to evaluate the blood compatibility of the polymer alloy. The SPU/MPC polymer alloy suppressed protein adsorption on the surface before and after the heat treatment. Based on these results, it is concluded that the SPU/MPC polymer alloy has an excellent potential for application in various medical devices.",
        "Materials and devices intended for end-use applications as implants and medical devices must be evaluated to determine their biocompatibility potential in contact with physiological systems. The use of standard practices of biological testing provides a reasonable level of confidence concerning the response of a living organism to a given material or device, as well as guidance in selecting the proper procedures to be carried out for the screening of new or modified materials. This article presents results from cytotoxicity assays of cell culture, skin irritation, and acute toxicity by systemic and intracutaneous injections for powders, ceramic bodies, and extract liquids of hydroxyapatite (HA), calcia partially stabilized zirconia (ZO), and two types of zirconia-hydroxyapatite composites (Z4H6 and Z6H4) with potential for future use as orthopedic and dental implants. They indicate that these materials present potential for this type of application because they meet the requirements of the standard practices recommended for evaluating the biological reactivity of ATCC cell cultures (CCL1 NCTC clone 929 of mouse connective tissue and CCL 81 of monkey connective tissue) and animals (rabbit and mouse) with direct or indirect patient contact, or by the injection of specific extracts prepared from the material under test. In addition, studies involving short-term intramuscular and long-term implantation assays to estimate the reaction of living tissue to the composites studied, and investigations on long-term effects that these materials can cause on the cellular metabolism, are already in progress.",
        "A polyetherurethane (PU) film containing 0.1% zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (ZDEC) is the international standard reference material for testing the in vitro cytotoxicity of polymer based biomaterials. Nowadays, culturing L929 or BALB/3T3 cells in direct contact or in an extract dilution condition is the most frequently using method for evaluating the cytotoxicity from biomaterials and medical devices. However, the results often vary, because it is directly related to the cellular functions and the mechanism of the toxicity of the contacting cells. In this study, 13 cell lines originating from various tissues were used to detect the cytotoxic activities of a PU film containing 0.1% ZDEC (PU-ZDEC). The correlation between the reactivity zone size and the relative cytotoxicity by quantifying the released total protein from each cell in the direct contact testing method was investigated. Hepa-1c1c7 cells demonstrated the highest sensitivity in the reactivity zone size, while CHO/dhFr(-) cells were the most sensitive in terms of the relative cytotoxicity. A correlation between the two processes in each cell line was not found (r=-0.478). In the extract dilution method, which involved cultivating the cells in the medium with various ZDEC concentrations prepared by diluting the PU incubation, the cytotoxicity increased with increasing ZDEC concentration in all cell lines. The BALB/ 3T3 cells demonstrated the highest sensitivity in the extract dilution method. No correlation in a comparison of the relative cytotoxicity from the direct contact method with the extract dilution method in each cell line, was found (r=-0.445). In this experiment, Hepa-1c1c7, BALB/3T3, CHO/dhFr(-) and L-929 cells among the 13 types of cell lines were the sensitive cell lines according to the two methods. The preliminary results suggest that a comparison of at least one or more cytotoxicity testing methods and many cell lines is necessary for an in vitro cytotoxicity test of biomaterials.",
        "Bacteria frequently attach to medical devices such as intravascular catheters by forming sessile multicellular communities known as biofilms, which can be the source of persistent infections that are recalcitrant to systemic antibiotic therapy. As a result of this persistence, a number of technologies have been developed to prevent catheter-associated biofilm formation. Whereas the most straightforward approaches focus on impregnating catheter material with classical antimicrobial agents, these approaches are not universally effective, thereby underscoring the need for more potent and more sophisticated approaches to the prevention of catheter-related biofilm infections.",
        "Biocompatibility of a material has to be adapted to the specific properties of the locus of application that are the type of tissue and the composition of extracellular fluid or the blood being in contact with the surface. The biocompatibility is beyond that greatly influenced by the design of the medical device which has to be planned close to the material's properties and the function within the body. Physical chemical reactions at and physical properties of the surface which influence the adsorption behavior for biomacromolecules. Conformational or functional changes of f.i. proteins due to physical forces originating from the surface could be the communication messages to the immunological system. The immersion of a material into an aqueous electrolyte leads generally to a space charge layer on both sides of the interface forming the electrical double layer, physically described by the isoelectric point of the materials surface. A numerical example hints on the importance of the double layer structure for the 'communication' between an implant and the surrounding extracellular fluid including beside ions complex structured proteins as biomacromolecules. Biocompatibility depends on the physical structure of the material and physicochemical properties of the interface to the biosystem. The conductivity of the surface film control reactions across the interface with biomacromolecules of the biological environment. Conformational unchanged macromolecules are the prior condition for biocompatibility and controls the attachment and probably also the degree of attachment via adhesion proteins. Later on, when the cells develop tension through the cytoskeleton on these attachment sites, the strength of the integrin adhesion protein-matrix protein interaction might probably prove decisive in differentiation state of the cell. It has been proved by molecular biological methods that an undestroyed oxide layer of anatase on titanium through passivation leaves for instance albumin conformational unchanged.",
        "Many medical devices use high-rate, low-amplitude currents to affect neural function. This study examined the effect of stimulation rate upon action potential threshold and sustained firing rate for two model neurons, the rabbit myelinated fibre and the unmyelinated leech touch sensory cell. These model neurons were constructed with the NEURON simulator from electrophysiological data. Alternating-phase current pulses (0-1250 Hz), of fixed phase duration (0.2 ms), were used to stimulate the neurons, and propagation success or failure was measured. One effect of the high pulse rates was to cause a net depolarisation, and this was verified by the relief of action potential conduction block by 500 Hz extracellular stimulation in leech neurons. The models also predicted that the neurons would maintain maximum sustained firing at a number of different stimulation rates. For example, at twice threshold, the myelinated model followed the stimulus up to 500 Hz stimulation, half the stimulus rate up to 850 Hz stimulation, and it did not fire at 1250 Hz stimulation. By contrast, the unmyelinated neuron model had a lower maximum firing rate of 190 Hz, and this rate was obtained at a number of stimulation rates, up to 1250 Hz. The myelinated model also predicted sustained firing with 1240 Hz stimulation at threshold current, but no firing when the current level was doubled. Most of these effects are explained by the interaction of stimulus pulses with the cell's refractory period.",
        "Cholesterol 1,2,3 9 (TM) is being promoted as a non-invasive way to measure cholesterol that has accumulated in a person's skin. The test received a medical device licence from Health Canada in January 2001. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2002. This test is not intended to be used as a screening tool for coronary artery disease in the general population. Evidence from non-randomized, non-blinded clinical trials suggests a correlation between higher skin cholesterol levels and the presence of severe coronary arterial lesions. At this point, technical improvements and more robust evidence are required to determine the significance of this technology in clinical practice.",

Searching for optimal results, we have utilized a new device; the Silastic ring has been replaced by the Proring-Band.\n174 mini-laparotomy SRVGs (mini-SRVG) were carried out with the Proring-Band from July 16, 2001 to May 31, 2002.\nThe ring is more flexible, slightly elastic and white-colored. At the operation, handling, fixing to the stomach and extraction were easier. No immediate postoperative complications or overall morbidities were related to the new band. No side-effect has been noted.\nThe Proring-Band appeared simpler in its use, during preparatory extra-body handling, placement and fixation. Considering its flexibility, its flat part and its smooth edges, the Proring-Band appears to present less risk of dysphagia, rupture and migration. This situation will be evaluated in a comparative blind study with a follow-up of more than 2 years. The Proring-Band ring is manufactured, sterilized and marketed by a pharmaceutical company. The use of this ring, provided as a medical device designed for restrictive surgery, assures to the surgeon a reproducibility of the material and of the sterilization conditions.",
        "The measurement of airway resistance using the interrupter technique (R(int)) is feasible in preschool children and other subjects unable to undertake spirometry. This makes it potentially useful for the measurement of lung function in these groups. Commercial devices use different algorithms to measure pressure and flow from which R(int) is derived. This study provides normative values for British children using devices from a single manufacturer.\nR(int) was measured in 236 healthy children of three ethnic groups (Afro-Caribbean and black African, Bangladeshi, and white British) aged 2-10 years using Micro Medical devices. Software in the devices calculated R(int) from pressure measured by the two point, back extrapolation method from the pressure transient during valve closure, with flow measured just before valve closure.\nR(int) is related to both age and height, but when age is allowed for there is not a significant relation with height. Neither gender nor any of the ethnicities studied was significantly related to R(int).\nThese measurements in healthy children using this technique may be used as reference data for similar populations.",

Such new technology may comprehend new drugs, new medical devices and appliances, new medical activities and surgical procedures, health promotion and disease prevention activities, and organizational and supporting systems. To achieve maximal use of available resources and constant selection among alternatives offered, health technology assessment is indispensable as a scientific effort to determine the extent to which and under what conditions a specific technology is efficacious, effective, safe, and cost-effective.

        "Latex allergy in the perioperative setting presents unique challenges to the health care system. Specific needs of the latex-sensitive patient are paramount, but consideration must also include the impact on health care workers vis-a-vis latex sensitization, environmental allergen control, and barrier protection against blood-borne pathogens. It has been well documented that the greatest source of latex aeroallergen in the surgical setting is latex gloves (both sterile and nonsterile). Levels of latex aeroallergen correlate strongly with use of high-allergen and powdered gloves, total number of gloves used, and the hours of activity in a given environment. A significant reduction in aeroallergen (>10-fold) can be achieved by switching to low-allergen gloves. Ready availability of and encouragement to use nonlatex alternatives when appropriate can further reduce exposure to latex allergens. Since 1998, the Food and Drug Administration has required all medical devices (or their packaging) that contain natural rubber latex to be so labeled. In addition, industry has responded with a host of latex-free products for use in patient care. This has helped eliminate a great deal of confusion about which products are safe for use with latex-sensitive individuals. However, despite significant efforts to educate the public and the health care industry regarding latex allergies, considerable misinformation persists. Provision of a completely latex-free environment in most surgical suites may be unrealistic, but every effort should be made to minimize the unnecessary exposure of patients and health care workers to latex allergens in this high-risk arena.",
        "There is increasing evidence that bacterial biofilms play a role in a variety of ocular infections. Bacterial growth is characterized as a biofilm when bacteria attach to a surface and/or to each other. This is distinguished from a planktonic or free-living mode of bacterial growth where these interactions are not present. Biofilm formation is a genetically controlled process in the life cycle of bacteria resulting in numerous changes in the cellular physiology of the organism, often including increased antibiotic resistance compared to growth under planktonic conditions. The presence of bacterial biofilms has been demonstrated on many medical devices including intravenous catheters, as well as materials relevant to the eye such as contact lenses, scleral buckles, suture material, and intraocular lenses. Many ocular infections often occur when such prosthetic devices come in contact with or are implanted in the eye. For instance, 56% of corneal ulcers in the United States are associated with contact lens wear. Bacterial biofilms may participate in ocular infections by allowing bacteria to persist on abiotic surfaces that come in contact with, or are implanted in the eye, and by direct biofilm formation on the biotic surfaces of the eye. An understanding of the role of bacterial biofilm formation in ocular infections may aid in the development of future antimicrobial strategies in ophthalmology. We review the current literature and concepts relating to biofilm formation and infections of the eye.",
        "Leukocytapheresis (LCAP) long has been investigated with a leukocyte removal filter for the treatment of various kinds of autoimmune related and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and so on. A lot of patients with such diseases have been reported to respond to LCAP. Asahi Medical Co. has developed the leukocyte removal filter Cellsorba and an extracorporeal treatment unit Plasauto LC so that the LCAP technique can be performed easily with a high performance filter, easy attachment of the blood circuit tubing set, and automatic operation. Cellsorba E has been listed as a medical device reimbursed by Japanese national health insurance to be used in LCAP for active ulcerative colitis since October 2001. Although the effective mechanism of LCAP is still controversial, the removal of activated leukocyte from the peripheral blood and the reaction by blood contacting materials in Cellsorba can be triggers of the immunomodulation for the treatment of immune disorder. This review introduces the development of LCAP technologies and several reports on therapeutic results.",
        "Injuries caused by sharp medical devices are common among health care workers and may result in the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus.\nThe direct medical costs associated with treating these injuries are well characterized but fail to capture the costs of such intangible factors as worker anxiety and distress. The objective of this study was to estimate these intangible costs.\nSubjects included health care workers reporting sharps-related injuries to 2 hospital occupational health services.\nA contingent valuation approach was used to assess willingness to pay to avoid sharps-related injuries among recently injured health care workers. Workers were presented with the option of paying out of pocket for a hypothetical injury-prevention device. The median amount of money subjects were willing to pay was estimated with logistic regression, and multivariable regression was performed to assess confounding by worker characteristics and circumstances surrounding injuries.\nStudy interviews were conducted for 116 subjects; median time from injury to interview was 3 days (range, 0-15). Most subjects were women (73%), and most were nurses (44%) or trainees (32%). The crude median amount subjects were willing to pay to avert injury was $850 (US); when adjusted for patient risk status (human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus status), and working with an uncooperative patient at the time of injury, median amount increased to $1270.\nThe high median amount subjects were willing to pay to avoid a sharps-related injury suggests that the costs of \"intangible\" aspects of worker injury, such as anxiety and distress, may equal costs associated with the medical evaluation of these injuries. These costs should be incorporated in economic analyses of sharps-injury prevention.",

        "The Food and Drug Administration has become aware of several instances where supposedly sterile medical surgical products made of Chinese cotton have been found to contain viable Pyronema domesticum. The aim of this research was to determine the gamma and electron beam radiation resistance values for the two dormant phases (ascospores and sclerotia) of P. domesticum. The resistance values were obtained by developing a standardized system to cultivate, purify, and harvest biological indicators containing sclerotia or ascospores. Ascospores were more resistant to radiation than sclerotia. The D(10) values for sclerotia were 0.79 and 1.09 kGy for strains 32030 and 14881, respectively. The resistance value for wild type ascospores was 2.83 kGy. The current standard for assuring radiation sterilization of medical devices is ISO 11137. This standard was developed to address the propensity for highly radiation-resistant organisms such as P. domesticum. Prior to the standard, biological indicators such as Bacillus pumilus, having a nominal D(10) value or 1.7 kGy, were used to determine the sterility of many medical devices.",
        "If the airway of a cardiac arrest patient is unprotected, basic life support with low rather than high inspiratory flow rates may reduce stomach inflation. Further, if the inspiratory flow rate is fixed such as with a resuscitator performance may improve; especially when used by less experienced rescuers. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of limited flow ventilation on respiratory variables, and lung and stomach volumes, when compared with a bag valve device. After institutional review board approval, and written informed consent was obtained, 20 critical care unit registered nurses volunteered to ventilate a bench model simulating a cardiac arrest patient with an unprotected airway consisting of a face mask, manikin head, training lung [with lung compliance, 50 ml/0.098 kPa (50 ml/cmH(2)O); airway resistance, 0.39 kPa/l/s (4 cmH(2)O/l/s)] oesophagus [lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, 0.49 kPa (5 cmH(2)O)] and simulated stomach. Each volunteer ventilated the model with a self-inflating bag (Ambu, Glostrup, Denmark; max. volume, 1500 ml), and a resuscitator providing limited fixed flow (Oxylator EM 100, CPR Medical devices Inc., Toronto, Canada) for 2 min; study endpoints were measured with 2 pneumotachometers. The self-inflating bag vs. resuscitator resulted in comparable mean +/- SD mask tidal volumes (945 +/- 104 vs. 921 +/- 250 ml), significantly (P < 0.05) higher peak inspiratory flow rates (111 +/- 27 vs. 45 +/- 21 l/min), and peak inspiratory pressure (1.2 +/- 0.47 vs. 78 +/- 0.07 kPa), but significantly shorter inspiratory times (1.1 +/- 0.29 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.35 s). Lung tidal volumes were comparable (337 +/- 120 vs. 309 +/- 61 ml), but stomach tidal volumes were significantly (P < 0.05) higher (200 +/- 95 vs. 140 +/- 51 ml) with the self-inflating bag. In conclusion, simulated ventilation of an unintubated cardiac arrest patient using a resuscitator resulted in decreased peak flow rates and therefore, in decreased peak airway pressures when compared with a self-inflating bag. Limited flow ventilation using the resuscitator decreased stomach inflation, although lung tidal volumes were comparable between groups.",
        "An in vitro human monocyte culture system was used to determine whether adherent monocyte/macrophage cytokine production was influenced by material surface chemistry. A polyethylene terephthalate (PET) base surface was modified by photograft copolymerization to yield hydrophobic, hydrophilic, anionic and cationic surfaces. Freshly isolated human monocytes were cultured onto the surfaces for periods up to 10 days in the presence or absence of interleukin-4 (IL-4). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis on days 3, 7 and 10 of cell culture revealed that interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression significantly increased in cells adherent to the hydrophilic and anionic surfaces but significantly decreased in the cationic surface adherent monocytes/macrophages. Conversely, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression was significantly decreased in cells adherent to the hydrophilic and anionic surfaces. Further analysis revealed that the hydrophilic and anionic surfaces inhibited monocyte adhesion and IL-4-mediated macrophage fusion into foreign body giant cells (FBGCs). Therefore, hydrophilic and anionic surfaces promote an anti-inflammatory type of response by dictating selective cytokine production by biomaterial adherent monocytes and macrophages. These studies contribute information necessary to enhance our understanding of biocompatibility to be used to improve the in vivo lifetime of implanted medical devices and prostheses.",

        "The cost-effectiveness of propofol anesthesia using target-controlled infusion (TCI) versus a standard regimen using desflurane for anesthesia maintenance was analyzed. This observational study consisted of 100 inpatients 18 to 75 years old with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I or II who were scheduled for otological surgery lasting less than four hours. Patients received one of two treatments. The desflurane-maintenance group received propofol 2-4 mg/kg and sufentanil 0.15-0.30 microg (as the citrate)/kg. A constant fresh gas flow of 1 L/min was used during maintenance of anesthesia. The propofol-maintenance group received TCI propofol and an additional infusion of sufentanil. Anesthesia was induced with 0.15-0.30 microg/kg. One blinded evaluator assessed the postoperative recovery from anesthesia for all patients. The cost of drugs and medical devices used during the intraoperative and postoperative periods was calculated. Effectiveness was defined as the absence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), while the cost-effectiveness of each procedure was the cost per PONV-free episode. The efficiency of each procedure represented the production of effectiveness per dollar invested. Chi-square and t tests, sensitivity analysis, and logistic regression were also performed. The only intergroup difference detected was the frequency of PONV occurring in the early recovery phase (11 in the desflurane group versus 2 in the propofol group). Of those patients requiring antiemetic rescue, 9 were in the desflurane group and only 2 were in the propofol group (p < 0.05). The TCI propofol regimen was more expensive than the desflurane regimen ($45 versus $28 per patient, respectively) (p < 0.001). The differential cost-effectiveness ratio was $94.7 per PONV-free episode. PONV 24 hours after surgery and patient satisfaction were similar between groups. A standard regimen of desflurane was more cost-effective than TCI propofol for anesthesia maintenance in achieving PONV-free episodes.",
        "Prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease represent a unique infection control problem because prions exhibit an unusual resistance to conventional chemical and physical decontamination methods. This paper reviews the recent literature and provides recommendations for the prevention of nosocomial transmission of prion agents.\nRecommendations to prevent the cross-transmission of infection from medical devices potentially contaminated with prions have been based primarily on prion inactivation studies. Newer recommendations consider inactivation data, but also use epidemiological studies of prion transmission, the infectivity of human tissues, and the efficacy of removing microbes by cleaning. Prion-specific disinfection/sterilization is required in only limited settings. Healthcare workers are not at risk of acquiring transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Blood or blood products have not been demonstrated to be vehicles for transmission.\nOn the basis of scientific data, only critical (e.g. surgical instruments) and semicritical devices contaminated with high-risk tissue (i.e. brain, spinal cord, eye) from high-risk patients (e.g. with known or suspected Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) require special treatment.",

        "The prominent cell type found on implanted medical devices during the chronic inflammatory response is the monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM). Using an activated in vitro cell system, it was possible to show that MDMs possess esterolytic activities that may contribute to the degradation of polyurethanes. In the present study, the U937 cell line was paralleled to the MDM cell system in order to validate the use of a cell line that could expedite studies on biomaterial biocompatibility and biostability. Using 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (PMA), the optimum differentiation time for the U937 cells was 72 h based on biodegradation, degradative potential, and (35)S-methionine uptake. After activation of the cells by resuspending from tissue culture polystyrene plates and reseeding onto a (14)C-labeled polycarbonate-based polyurethane(PCNU), both U937 cells and the MDMs elicited comparable radiolabel release (measure of polymer breakdown) and esterase activity (measure of degradative potential) at 48 h. There was no difference in the effect on radiolabel release and esterase activity elicited by both cell types with inhibitors of protein synthesis, esterase activity, and phospholipase A(2). This established that both cell types likely used similar hydrolytic activities and signaling pathways to cause degradation of the PCNU. Immunoblotting demonstrated that both cell systems secreted monocyte-specific esterase and cholesterol esterase enzymes previously shown to degrade PCNUs. The U937 cell system is more convenient and reproducible than MDMs for pursuing possible biological pathways elucidating the mechanism of polyurethane biodegradation. Once established with U937s, the pathways can then be validated with the more physiologically relevant human MDM cell system.",
        "Biomaterial-mediated infection, a common cause of medical device failure, is initiated by bacterial adhesion to an adsorbed protein layer on the implant surface. This adhesion is thought to be mediated by specific molecules present on the bacterial cell surface. Optical tweezers can be used to measure the adhesive force between a single bacterium and a protein-coated surface.\nUsing optical tweezers, a bacterium was trapped and brought in contact with a 10-microm diameter polystyrene microsphere coated with fibronectin. The minimum force required to detach the cell from the bead was determined over a range of fibronectin concentrations and contact times.\nThe detachment forces were integer multiples of an 18-pN base value that was independent of contact time and coating concentration; we propose that the variation in force is related to the number of bonds formed.\nThese experiments demonstrate that optical tweezers can be used to investigate the adhesion of individual bacteria to surfaces. The results suggest that S. epidermidis has surface proteins capable of binding fibronectin.",

        "The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a virus-inactivating process for use during the preparation of porcine-derived extracellular matrix biomaterials for human clinical implantation. Porcine small intestine, the source material for the tissue-engineered, small intestinal submucosa (SIS) biomaterial, was evaluated. Relevant enveloped, non-enveloped, and model viruses representative of different virus families were included in the investigation: porcine parvovirus (PPV), porcine reovirus, murine leukemia retrovirus (LRV), and porcine pseudorabies (herpes) virus (PRV). Samples of small intestine were deliberately inoculated with approximately 1 x 10(7) plaque-forming units (PFU) of virus which were thereafter exposed to a 0.18% peracetic acid/4.8% aqueous ethanol mixture for time periods ranging from 5 minutes to 2 hours. Enveloped viruses were more easily inactivated than non-enveloped viruses, but material processed for 30 minutes or longer inactivated all of the viruses. D(10) values were calculated and used to extrapolate the extent of inactivation after 2 hours. Viral titers were reduced by more than 14.0 log(10) PPV, 21.0 log(10) reovirus, 40.0 log(10) PRV, and 27.0 log(10) LRV, meeting international standards for viral sterility. These results demonstrate that treatment of porcine small intestine with a peracetic acid/ethanol solution leads to a virus-free, non-crosslinked biomaterial safe for xenotransplantation into humans.",
        "Why does LEA-D intervention seem to work in some systems but not others? Panelists agreed that some factors that delay rapid access to treatment, such as long travel distances in rural areas, may represent insurmountable barriers. Other factors, however, may be addressed more readily. These include: absence of a medical response culture, discomfort with the role of medical intervention, insecurity with the use of medical devices, a lack of proactive medical direction, infrequent refresher training, and dependence on EMS intervention. Panelists agreed that successful LEA-D programs possess ten key attributes (Table 6). In the end, the goal remains \"early\" defibrillation, not \"police\" defibrillation. It does not matter whether the rescuer wears a blue uniform--or any uniform, for that matter--so long as the defibrillator reaches the victim quickly. If LEA personnel routinely arrive at medical emergencies after other emergency responders or after 8 minutes have elapsed from the time of collapse, an LEA-D program will be unlikely to provide added value. Similarly, if police frequently arrive first, but the department is unwilling or unable to cultivate the attributes of successful LEA-D programs, efforts to improve survival may not be realized. In most communities, however, LEA-D programs have tremendous lifesaving potential and are well worth the investment of time and resources. Law enforcement agencies considering adoption of AED programs should review the frequency with which police arrive first at medical emergencies and LEA response intervals to determine whether AED programs might help improve survival in their communities. It is time for law enforcement agency defibrillation to become the rule, not the exception.",

        "This article presents a discussion of some challenges in the design of a multi-function patient monitor. The term \"multi-function patient monitor\" refers to a single medical device that monitors multiple physiological parameters from the same patient. A common configuration of the monitor is a personal computer (PC) platform communicating with several modules each designed to monitor one physiological parameter. Although such an integration of modules allows the modules to access to the display screen, keyboard, power supply and printer of the PC, the integration also involves new design challenges. The foremost challenge is the increased demand on the PC's resources, while another challenge is compatibility among the various modules. Examples of compatibility are electromagnetic compatibility, and clinical compatibility. A well-known example of incompatibility is the non-invasive blood pressure monitor cuff cutting off blood flow to the finger with a pulse oximeter probe, resulting in a Low Signal alarm in the pulse oximeter. Other challenges include clutter on the display screen and confusing alarm annunciation. This article discusses these design challenges and proposes some solutions based on engineering principles, and common sense considerations. Examples will also be drawn from case reports available in the public domain.",

        "The halo orthosis is a medical device used to immobilize the cervical spine when an injury to the region is sustained. This device consists of a halo vest, support rods, a ring, and four pins that contact the skull. The halo is applied to the patient by securing the halo ring to the skull with four pointed pins that are threaded into a halo ring. In an effort to produce a desired initial force in each pin, a specified torque (typically 0.9 N-m) is applied to the pin. One problem associated with the existing method is that it produces a wide range of initial pin forces despite a constant applied torque. The existing method is particularly sensitive to the presence of medical agents (e.g. antibacterial ointments or hydrogen peroxide) that may change frictional characteristics at the pin site or at the threaded hole in the halo ring. Variability in initial forces from an applied torque of 0.9 N-m (8 in-lbf) have been reported in the literature. These forces vary from 620 N (140 lbf) when hydrogen peroxide is applied to the threads and pin site up to 980 N (220 lbf) when antibacterial ointment is applied to the threads and pin site. We present a new method of tightening halo pins that reduces the variability of the initial pin force. Using the new method, a known force is applied to the pin to provide a preload. Once the appropriate preload is applied, the halo pin is secured in place relative to the halo ring and the applied force is removed leaving the pin in the final configuration. We compare the existing method and the new proposed method by examining a single pin site. The pin force data display less sensitivity to lubricants using the new direct loading technique.",
        "The halo orthosis is a medical device used to immobilize the cervical spine when an injury to the region is sustained. This device consists of a halo vest, support rods, a ring, and four pins that contact the skull. A major problem experienced with the halo is pin loosening. In our previous research, we were able to model the halo orthosis as a mechanism and use kinematic principles to analyze the constraint characteristics. Using the Grubler/Kutzbach equation (a well accepted method of characterizing constraint systems), we were able to show that the halo orthosis is over-constrained which could be a possible source of pin loosening. We now present preliminary data that will show decreasing axial pin force and observed geometry changes that occur at each pin site. Biomechanical tests were performed on two cadaver skulls using a tensile loading machine that simulated the forces exerted by a patient. We were able to observe the changes in axial forces at each of the pins using load cells as cyclic transverse forces were applied. Our results show a force reduction over time at each pin site. We also discovered that the effects of creep are significant and potentially contribute to pin loosening.",

        "In Europe the marketing of medical devices manufactured from latex is regulated by directives describing the essential (safety) requirements that products have to fulfill to obtain marketing approval. This paper describes the general requirements for marketing medical devices in Europe and, more specifically, the requirements for products manufactured from natural rubber latex. The requirements for marketing medical devices can be fulfilled by using the relevant harmonized European standards. These standards are regularly under revision to incorporate the latest scientific developments. For certain devices, for example, latex medical (examination and surgical) gloves, specific standards have been published. Medical devices manufactured from latex pose a serious problem because of the risk of induction of allergy both against the latex proteins inherently present (type I or immediate type allergy) and against chemicals added during processing (type IV or delayed type hypersensitivity) present as residues in the latex products. So, besides requirements for product quality in terms of barrier properties, strength, and sterility, the main focus consists of the allergy-inducing properties of the latex products. Recent developments have reopened the discussion on the value of total protein versus allergen determination in latex medical gloves. However, as long as minimal levels needed for both sensitization and elicitation have not been established, a safe maximum level for leachable proteins/allergens in latex products cannot be determined. A European Commission guidance document on the latex allergy problem is currently being drafted by experts from Competent Authorities.",

        "Silicone breast implants have been marketed in the United States since 1963. Questions remain unanswered on the safety of these medical devices despite their popularity and availability. In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration restricted the availability of silicone-gel breast implants to women requiring them for reconstruction after breast cancer or for other medical indications. Inflatable saline breast implants have remained available for either reconstruction or for cosmetic augmentation while manufacturers completed studies addressing issues of safety and effectiveness. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has less concern today regarding a putative association between breast implants and autoimmune disease because of epidemiologic studies that have indicated that there is not a large increase in risk for connective tissue disease in women with breast implants. These studies have not ruled out a small increase in risk of connective tissue disease to these women nor have they addressed the issue of an atypical syndrome related to silicone. The FDA has continuing concerns over local complications that are related to breast implants. The current review provides a brief discussion of the regulatory history of silicone implants and of FDA concerns over breast implants, implant prevalence, studies of systemic and local complications related to breast implants, and a brief description of the FDA study of silicone-gel breast implant rupture.",

A minimal risk situation cannot meanwhile be maintained unless hospitals and other healthcare institutions are prepared and have effective and well-functioning decontamination procedures in place suited for the purpose. The guidelines recommend that staff both in the operating theatre and in the Central Sterile Supply Department (CSSD) must be able to apply the procedures needed for safe handling and decontamination of used instruments. These include cleaning and effective sterilisation, as well as quarantine procedures and ways to discard and incinerate certain used instruments. The guidelines also address occupational safety, and single-use instruments are recommended where these are available and can be safely used. Effective procedures for decontamination of instruments and other medical devices are identified as the key to prevention of iatrogenic spread of TSE.

For reasons of animal welfare and better science, many validation studies of various in vitro methods were performed between 1985 and 1995 for their potential to replace the Draize eye irritation test. Albeit the fact that four in vitro methods (HET-CAM, BCOP, IRE, and ECE) have gained regulatory tolerance in Europe for the classification of severe eye irritants, the lessons learned mainly from these validation studies led to the definition of internationally harmonised OECD validation principles and acceptance criteria (Final Report of the OECD Workshop on Harmonization of Validation and Acceptance Criteria for Alternative Toxicological Tests Methods, 1996. OECD Publication Office, Paris, France). Application of these principles to prevalidation and validation studies, and additional special studies performed in Europe with the support of ECVAM, ended in the scientific validation of new in vitro methods for the prediction of skin corrosivity and phototoxicity. They were accepted for regulatory use in Europe and adopted on 8 June 2000 as test methods B. 40 and B. 41 of Annex V of Directive 67/548/EEC.

        "Recent years have witnessed a rapidly growing crisis in antimicrobial resistance, especially among microorganisms that cause nosocomial infection. To better understand common risk factors among multiresistant organisms, this review explores risk factors for nosocomial infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, Clostridium difficile, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli, and Candida. This review comprises data from 74 published studies; 53 (71%) were retrospective studies and addressed few risk factors or did not quantify risk. The analysis shows impressive commonality of risk factors across these diverse multiresistant organisms: advanced age; underlying diseases and severity of illness; inter-institutional transfer of the patient, especially from a nursing home; prolonged hospitalization; gastrointestinal surgery or transplantation; exposure to invasive devices of all types, especially central venous catheters; and exposure to antimicrobial drugs, especially cephalosporins. More restricted use of antibiotics, especially cephalosporins, and strategies to prevent medical device-related infection and cross-infection in the hospital would yield benefit with all types of resistant organisms. Preemptive isolation of all patients with risk factors for infection by resistant organisms would very likely reduce secondary spread within the hospital. Conversely, programs that focus on only one organism or one antimicrobial drug are unlikely to succeed. Prospective studies of sufficient size that address all potential risk factors, especially individual anti-infective agents, and that use matched controls who are shown by surveillance cultures to be free of colonization by resistant organisms would enhance understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in institutions and guide efforts to develop more effective strategies for prevention.",

        "BACKGROUND AND AIMS. One of the greatest challenges confronting physicians who are managing the care of patients with heart failure is to acquire objective data that signals treatment effectiveness and/or disease progression. The aim of this study was twofold: 1) to determine the extent to which (real time) impedance cardiography measurements obtained with a specific medical device (the BioZ) were reproducible in outpatients with clinically stable heart failure; and 2) to establish \"normal\" ranges of one week hemodynamic variability in this population of patients. Information of this nature would help clinical cardiologists and primary care practitioners to evaluate the implications of their patient's visit-to-visit hemodynamic variability. METHODS. A one group, prospective, time series design was used. The sample consisted of 62 patients who had clinically stable heart failure and who were being treated in an outpatient heart failure clinic at a university medical center. BioZ hemodynamic measures of cardiac output, contractility, and after load were obtained at five points in time: two, 10, and 60 minutes resting following a 40-50 foot walk on the first day and at two and 10 minutes resting following a 40-50 foot walk on the second day, one week later. RESULTS. Small but significant changes in cardiac output and cardiac index (mainly due to changes in heart rate) were seen during the 60-minute period on week one. Stroke index did not change during this period. In general, reproducibility between measurements taken on the same day and between days was quite good. Establishment of 95% confidence intervals helped define boundaries of variability in this population. Further clinical evaluation of the four patients whose values exceeded the 95% confidence intervals revealed unexpected, potentially relevant changes that could have accounted for their interday variability. Conclusion. The BioZ impedance cardiography measurements are responsive to hemodynamic activity-rest changes and are reproducible at a one week interval in clinically stable heart failure patients being treated in an outpatient clinic. Stroke index is a better measure of patient status than cardiac output or cardiac index. (c)2000 by CHF, Inc.",
        "The routine sampling of environmental surfaces within a healthcare facility is generally not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), and several other healthcare organizations. There are a few circumstances, however, for which some organizations do recommend this practice. For instance, the CDC and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) recommend environmental sampling as clinically required during an outbreak investigation. The CDC and AAMI also recommend routine sampling of the rinse water used during hemodialyzer (but not endoscope) reprocessing. The rationale for this recommendation is based in part on reports of pyrogenic responses, patient infections, and bacteremia due to waterborne, gram-negative bacteria during hemodialysis. To determine whether the basis for this rationale might similarly apply to the rinse water used during endoscope reprocessing, the Food and Drug Administration's medical device reporting database, the endoscope reprocessing literature, and other sources were reviewed. The results of this review indicate that nosocomial outbreaks linked to endoscopes contaminated with gram-negative bacteria have been frequently reported. As a result, for several reasons, including to minimize the risk of patient infection due to gram-negative bacteria following endoscopy, this article recommends routine microbiologic sampling of the rinse water used during endoscope reprocessing.",
        "Natural rubber latex allergy is a serious medical problem for a growing number of patients and a disabling occupational disease among health care workers. Latex allergy develops from exposure to natural rubber latex, a plant cytosol that is used extensively to manufacture medical gloves, other medical devices, and numerous consumer products.

Polycarbonate films prepared by solvent casting technique from various solvents were gamma-irradiated in the range of 0-200 kGy. Characterizations of the films were achieved by contact angle and water-uptake studies as well as atomic force microscope (AFM) images. It was found that gamma-irradiated films were more hydrophilic than unmodified films. AFM images showed that surface roughness increased with gamma irradiation. Protein adsorption experiments conducted with human plasma demonstrated that protein adsorptions drastically increased by increasing the applied irradiation dose. The unirradiated and gamma-irradiated films were contacted with human blood in in vitro systems. Loss of the blood cells and clotting times were followed. Loss of blood cells in the plasma contacting with gamma-irradiated films was negligible. Any significant change was also followed for clotting times with gamma-radiation dose.",
        "Health care providers are at risk for infection with bloodborne pathogens, including hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C virus. Recommended infection control practices are applicable to all settings in which dental treatment is provided. Dentists remain at low risk for occupationally acquired human immunodeficiency virus. Dental health care workers, through occupational exposure, may have a 10 times greater risk of becoming a chronic hepatitis B carrier than the average citizen. Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In general, persons suspected of having pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis should be considered infectious if they are coughing, are undergoing cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures, or have sputum smears positive for acid-fast bacilli. Although the possibility of transmission of bloodborne infections from dental health care workers to patients is considered to be small, precise risks have not been quantified by carefully designed epidemiologic studies. Emphasis should be placed on consistent adherence to recommended infection control strategies, including the use of protective barriers and appropriate methods of sterilization or disinfection. Each dental facility should develop a written protocol for instrument reprocessing, operatory cleanup, and management of injuries. Such efforts may lead to the development of safer and more effective medical devices, work practices, and personal protective equipment.",

        "The purpose of this research effort was to evaluate in vivo a newly developed dexamethasone/PLGA microsphere system designed to suppress the inflammatory tissue response to an implanted device, in this case a biosensor. The microspheres were prepared using an oil/water (O/W) emulsion technique. The microsphere system was composed of drug-loaded microspheres (including newly formulated and predegraded microspheres) and free dexamethasone. The combination of the drug and drug-loaded microspheres provided burst release of dexamethasone followed by continuous release from days 2-14. Continuous release to at least 30 days was achieved by mixing predegraded and newly formulated microspheres. The ability of our mixed microsphere system to control tissue reactions to an implant then was tested in vivo using cotton thread sutures to induce inflammation subcutaneously in Sprague-Dawley rats. Two different in vivo studies were performed, the first to find the dosage level of dexamethasone that effectively would suppress the acute inflammatory reaction and the second to show how effective the dexamethasone delivered by PLGA microspheres was in suppressing chronic inflammatory response to an implant. The first in vivo study showed that 0.1 to 0.8 mg of dexamethasone at the site minimized the acute inflammatory reaction. The second in vivo study showed that our mixed microsphere system suppressed the inflammatory response to an implanted suture for at least 1 month. This study has proven the viability of microsphere delivery of an anti-inflammatory to control the inflammatory reaction at an implant site.",

        "New biomaterial related reference materials with known genotoxic properties were produced in order to study the sample preparation and in vitro genotoxicity testing of biomaterials. We incorporated genotoxic substances like benzo[a]pyrene into the biomaterial Tecoflex, a polyurethane frequently used for catheters and other applications. We demonstrated that the model compound benzo[a]pyrene is sufficiently extracted by organic solvents, whereas cell culture medium only extracts very limited quantities. By changing the medium several times during extraction the extracted amount was augmented. Using higher amounts of organic solvent in relation to the reference material's surface led to a higher recovery of extracted benzo[a]pyrene. For the in vitro genotoxicity testing using the Mammalian Cell Gene Mutation Test (HPRT test), Mammalian Chromosome Aberration Test, and bacterial umu- and SOS-tests, concentration of extracts is a prerequisite because of the low sensitivity of the test systems. Often cytotoxicity interferes with the evaluation of genotoxic effects. We demonstrated that some recommendations of the ISO 10993-Part 3 and 12,(1),(2) dealing with the biological evaluation of medical devices, seem to be insufficient, and new rules for the in vitro genotoxicity testing of biomaterials have to be established.",
        "A plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) surface was modified by azidation using sodium azide in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst in aqueous media. Subsequent to azidation, the surface was crosslinked using ultraviolet radiation. Contact angle measurements showed that the surface became hydrophilic on azidation whereas photoirradiation did not have any further effect on the hydrophilicity of the azidated surface. Control, azidated, and photocrosslinked surfaces were exposed to two strains of bacteria commonly implicated in device infection such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Whereas the control and photocrosslinked surfaces showed no significant difference in bacterial adhesion, the azidated surface showed significantly reduced adhesion to both strains. Data obtained indicate that the presence of an intact azide function on the polymer surface is responsible for the reduced bacterial adherence and the surface hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity did not exert any effect in the present case. Although azides are known to be effective only against Gram-negative species, surprising was the observation that the azidated polymer surface was equally effective against a Gram-positive species such as S. aureus. Because sodium azide is routinely used as a preservative to prevent bacterial and fungal growth in many microbiology reagents and diagnostic kits, covalent binding of the azide onto a polymer surface or synthesizing azide containing polymers may be an interesting method to investigate in tackling the problem of bacterial adhesion and colonization of medical devices.",

        "On 6 June 2000, the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) recommended that all Trilucent (soya-bean-oil filled) breast implants should be removed. This accelerated a trend that had already begun in our unit. This study follows our previous report on a 3 year series of women with Trilucent breast implants. The aim was to present our operative findings at explantation, and to correlate them with the preoperative signs and symptoms, the postoperative complications and the details of the hospital stay. In total, 44 patients (82 implants) underwent explantation, of whom 34 were cosmetic cases and 10 were reconstructive. Five patients had their implants removed before the MDA announcement. Implant rippling was the most common problem reported (25%), followed by pain (18%), implant deflation (9.1%) and capsular contracture (4.5%). Free oil was seen around the implant in 15 cases; four of these presented with clinical deflation, and three with rippling. The remaining eight patients were asymptomatic. We conclude that these implants tend to bleed, as evidenced by the presence of free oil around the implant in 34% of patients. The absence of free oil in 73% of the patients who presented with rippling suggests that the leaking oil is often metabolised and absorbed. The findings of this study are significant for women in whom free oil was found around the implant during explantation, and for those who still have Trilucent implants in place, for whatever reason, in spite of the MDA recommendation.",

        "Adverse drug events are the single leading threat to patient safety. Human factors engineering has been repeatedly proposed, but largely untested, as the key to improving patient safety. The value of this approach was investigated in the context of a commercially available patient-controlled analgesia device that has been linked with several alleged patient injuries and deaths. Several reports have stated that errors in programming drug concentration were made during these adverse drug events. A simulation of the commercially available interface was compared experimentally with a simulated prototype of a new interface designed according to a human factors process. Professional nurses, averaging over 5 years of clinical experience with the commercially available interface and only minimal experience with the new interface, programmed both interfaces. The new interface eliminated drug concentration errors, whereas the simulated commercially available interface did not. Also, the new interface led to significantly fewer total errors and faster performance. These findings may have broad implications for the design, regulation, and procurement of biomedical devices, products, or systems that improve patient safety in clinical settings.",

        "Bacterial colonization of mammary implants is a prelude to clinical infection and has been implicated in the etiology of capsular contracture. Antimicrobial impregnation of a variety of medical devices with the combination of minocycline and rifampin has recently emerged as a potentially effective method for preventing device colonization and device-related infection. The objective of this animal study was to examine in vivo the antimicrobial efficacy of minocycline/rifampin-impregnated, saline-filled silicone implants. A rabbit model of Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection of subcutaneously placed implants was used. A total of 48 saline-filled silicone implants (24 antimicrobe-impregnated and 24 control unimpregnated implants) were suspended in a 106 colony-forming units/ml bacterial suspension of S. aureus for 30 minutes at room temperature, allowed to dry for 60 minutes, and then implanted subcutaneously in the back of 12 rabbits (two antimicrobe-impregnated and two control implants were placed in each rabbit). Rabbits were monitored daily, then killed either at 2 weeks (10 rabbits) or at 4 weeks (two rabbits) and cultured. The antimicrobe-impregnated implants were 12 times less likely to be colonized than control unimpregnated implants (two of 24 versus 23 of 24; p < 0.001), and they were a significantly less likely cause of implant-related infection (0 of 24 versus 22 of 24; p < 0.001) and implant-related abscess (0 of 24 versus 21 of 24; p < 0.001) than control implants. The minocycline/rifampin-impregnated implants routinely demonstrated zones of inhibition against S. aureus at the time of explantation. These results indicate that minocycline/rifampin-impregnated implants can significantly decrease the rate of bacterial colonization, implant-related infection, and implant-related abscess. Antimicrobe-impregnated implants also have the potential of reducing the likelihood of capsular contracture.",

With these tools, the distinctions between inert materials, resorbables, bioactive materials, transplantable tissues, engineered tissues, drugs, and composites become indistinct. Although almost any implanted material evokes some type of host reaction, in the context of reconstructive orthopaedic surgery, bioactive materials can be considered osteogenic, osteoconductive, osteoinductive, or a combination thereof. In the United States, the regulatory control of a new skeletal substitute material is complex, and is based in part on whether the material is considered primarily a biologic, a drug, or a medical device. Different agencies within the Food and Drug Administration have responsibility for regulatory control of different types of products.

        "Though biofilms were first described by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, the theory describing the biofilm process was not developed until 1978. We now understand that biofilms are universal, occurring in aquatic and industrial water systems as well as a large number of environments and medical devices relevant for public health. Using tools such as the scanning electron microscope and, more recently, the confocal laser scanning microscope, biofilm researchers now understand that biofilms are not unstructured, homogeneous deposits of cells and accumulated slime, but complex communities of surface-associated cells enclosed in a polymer matrix containing open water channels. Further studies have shown that the biofilm phenotype can be described in terms of the genes expressed by biofilm-associated cells. Microorganisms growing in a biofilm are highly resistant to antimicrobial agents by one or more mechanisms. Biofilm-associated microorganisms have been shown to be associated with several human diseases, such as native valve endocarditis and cystic fibrosis, and to colonize a wide variety of medical devices. Though epidemiologic evidence points to biofilms as a source of several infectious diseases, the exact mechanisms by which biofilm-associated microorganisms elicit disease are poorly understood. Detachment of cells or cell aggregates, production of endotoxin, increased resistance to the host immune system, and provision of a niche for the generation of resistant organisms are all biofilm processes which could initiate the disease process. Effective strategies to prevent or control biofilms on medical devices must take into consideration the unique and tenacious nature of biofilms. Current intervention strategies are designed to prevent initial device colonization, minimize microbial cell attachment to the device, penetrate the biofilm matrix and kill the associated cells, or remove the device from the patient. In the future, treatments may be based on inhibition of genes involved in cell attachment and biofilm formation.",

        "Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS) has been associated with primary bloodstream infections and implanted medical devices. Its importance is increasing due to the acquisition of resistance to oxacillin (Oxa) and, recently, resistance to mupirocin (Mup). Mupirocin, a topical antimicrobial, has been used in the prevention of staphylococci catheter colonization. Susceptibility to Oxa and Mup was analyzed by different testing methods in clinical CNS isolates. Among 112 CNS strains, 69 (61.6%) were Oxa(R) by the disk diffusion (DD) method and 72 (64.2%) grew on the oxacillin agar screen plate. S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus presented high rates of oxacillin resistance, 75.4% and 96.1%, respectively. Twenty four (21.4%) strains were Mup(R) by the DD test and 21 of them (87.5%) were identified as S. epidermidis. The detection of the mecA and ileS-2 genes, determined by multiplex-PCR, showed that 72 (64.2%) CNS strains possessed the mecA gene, while 16 (14.3%) possessed the ileS-2 gene. Fifteen of these strains presented the two resistance genes simultaneously. The isolates containing the ileS-2 gene presented a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >1024 microg/mL in the E-test, while low-level mupirocin resistance (MICs of 12-16 microg/mL) was observed in those strains without ileS-2. The resistances to high and low levels of mupirocin could not be distinguished when the DD test was used. The analysis of the Mup(R) S. epidermidis strains by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis showed that 17 (80.9%) strains belonged to one of two patterns (A and B), which have been shown to be prevalent in hospitals in Rio de Janeiro. This report showed that the PCR method for detection of oxacillin and mupirocin resistance in CNS is necessary to determine accurate rates of these resistance, and will can help in the staphylococcal infections prevention and control policies in Brazil.",

The microspheres were prepared using an oil-in-water emulsion technique. The oil phase was composed of 9:1 dichloromethane to methanol with dissolved PLGA and dexamethasone. Some microspheres were predegraded for 1 or 2 weeks. Ten percent of polyethylene glycol was added to the oil phase in alternative formulations to delay drug release. The in vitro release studies were performed in a constant temperature (37 C) warm room, in phosphate-buffered saline at sink conditions. Drug loading and release rates were determined by HPLC-UV analysis. The standard microsphere systems did not provide the desired release profile since, following an initial burst release, a delay of 2 weeks occurred prior to continuous drug release. Predegraded microspheres started to release dexamethasone immediately but the rate of release decreased after only 2 weeks. A mixed standard and predegraded microsphere system was used to avoid this delay and to provide continuous release of dexamethasone for 1 month.",

        "Drug-related illness is an important cause of admission to hospital. Little information is available regarding the frequency of ADRs caused by antilipidemic agents classified as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Treatment with statins has been associated with the occurrence of myopathy or liver toxicity in case reports. Recent lipid intervention studies have involved the implementation of lipid lowering therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in cardiovascular risk management. Since January 1997 we have been involved in a study, the aim of which was to improve the spontaneous drug information reporting system in Germany. The study was supported by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, the \"Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte\", Berlin BfArM. Between early 1997 and late 2000, as a result of this monitoring of ADRs, we analyzed all patient histories concerning therapy with statins. A total of 550 ADR patients were evaluated, (209 male, 341 female) with a mean age of 66.4 years. 27 (4.9%) of all patients had received statins (atorvastatin = 12, fluvastatin = 7, simvastatin as well as pravastatin = 3, lovastatin = 2). Only 2 of the 27 patients admitted to hospital for typical ADRs of statins such as skeletal muscle toxicity (e.g. myalgia, rhabdomyolysis) or disorders involving hepatic structure or function were receiving statins (atorvastatin). An increased risk of rhabdomyolysis has been reported in the case of several statins, following concomitant use with erythromycin, cyclosporine or itraconazole, all of which are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 enzyme. But only 1 atorvastatin patient had received cyclosporine as a CYP3A4 inhibitor. After discontinuing medication, signs of intoxication disappeared. The antihyperlipidemic drugs available are generally safe and effective, and rate of ADRs is low if concomitant intake of other drugs and the differing pharmacokinetic profiles of the statins are considered.",

The secondary purpose was to determine the participant's positive and negative impressions of the Humalog/Humulin pen and the likelihood of using the new prefilled pen. Three different modifications to the prefilled pen's IRD stop feature were made. These three pen models then underwent environmental dose accuracy testing at various temperatures and humidities, and user dose accuracy testing by 64 patients with diabetes. Evaluation also involved challenging the IRD stop at various dialing torques. Thirty pens from each model were tested to failure of the IRD stop. A model of the prefilled pen was selected for commercialization that met the dose accuracy targets of +/- 1 unit (U) for insulin doses less than 20 U and +/- 5% of dose volume for doses equal to or over 20 U. The selected pen model was superior at the minimum (1 unit), median (30 unit) and maximum (60 unit) dose volumes.

The study analysed the practical application of the system and its microbiological efficiency. Inactivation experiments were made with reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus hirae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Bacillus subtilis var niger, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Two thousand eight hundred treatment cycles, i.e. 84,000 grindings and 140,000 ozone injections gave a treatment capacity of 50 kg of waste per day with a good staff acceptability. All kinds of medical devices used in an intensive care unit were treated. In untreated ground wastes, the median bacterial load was 105.86 (range 10(2.35)-10(8.05)) cfu/g. After ozone treatment, bacteria and fungi were reduced by a factor of 10(5). Aero-contamination of the ward was unchanged. Computer control allowed all events to be tracked.

Intersessional repeatability was equivalent with (0.002 mm, CI +.- 0.51) and without a cover (0.03 mm, CI +/- 0.51). Readings with a cover were not significantly different from those without (paired t test; p >0.05), but tended to be greater (mean difference 0.085 mm, CI +/- 0.60).\nThese findings suggest that corneal contact biometry with a disposable cover is a viable and theoretically safer alternative to the conventional technique.",

        "Flexible endoscopes are complex medical instruments that are easily damaged. To maintain the flexible endoscope in optimum working condition, the user must have a thorough understanding of the structure and function of the instrument. This series of articles will present an in-depth look at the care and handling of these expensive devices. The flexible endoscope is constructed of several systems that operate simultaneously to produce a highly technical, yet effective diagnostic and therapeutic medical device. These systems include the air and water system, the suction and operating channel system, the mechanical system, the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) elevator system, the optical system, and the electrical system.

        "To compare the technical performance of a 33-mm core-length biopsy needle with that of the standard 18 mm needle, as many prostate cancers are isoechoic and in large prostates the tissue coverage with the 18 mm needle is inadequate.\nA 33-mm core length BioPince VSL disposable needle (Amedic, Sweden) and a standard TruCut 18 mm needle (Medical Device Technology Inc., FL, USA) were used to take prostatic biopsies in two groups of 15 patients. The following variables were assessed for each group: mean core length, core quality, capsular coverage (one or both capsules within the specimen), and side-effects in the first week after biopsy (for the BioPince group, surveyed using a self-completed questionnaire). The results were compared with historical data from a group of 30 patients biopsied using the standard needle.\nFor the BioPince and standard groups the mean (sd) core length was 19.4 (8.9) and 14.9 (5.1) mm, respectively. Four needles in the BioPince group failed to capture a sample, requiring needle replacement. The samples were fragmented in 15 of 90 (17%) and 41 of 90 (46%) biopsies in the BioPince and standard groups, respectively (P < 0.05). Specimens had both capsules present in five of 90 (6%) and four of 90 (4%), respectively. Within 7 days minor bleeding was the most common side-effect. Pain after biopsy was the only symptom showing a significant difference between the groups, at six of 15 and none (P = 0.001), respectively. The incidence of haematuria, haematospermia and rectal bleeding was similar in the two groups (P > 0.05), but fever more common (three vs none) in the BioPince group (P = 0.06).\nWhen set at a 33-mm stroke length, the BioPince needle increases the mean core length by 30%, with less fragmentation than a standard 18 mm needle. However, it has a significant failure rate for capture (27% needle replacement rate), slightly greater morbidity (pain and possibly fever) and shows no advantage in capsular coverage. Therefore, there are shortcomings with this end-cutting needle when used at 33 mm core length.",
        "The growing trend of prescription of reciprocal walking orthoses for children under the age of 5 years has created a requirement for a new design of orthosis in this category. In response to this new demand, a prototype orthosis for infants, incorporating a specially developed hip joint and manufactured as a rehabilitation engineering device within the provisions of the EC Medical Devices Directive, has been produced and tested. A design feature that strongly influences the efficiency of walking is the rigidity of the body brace structure. Monitoring the specific structural performance of the body brace intended for infants showed that it would equal or improve the stiffness achieved in an orthosis for adults. Additionally its strength was comparable with the adult design, which has proven to be safe and reliable in many years of routine prescription. Incorporation of the infant body brace within a complete orthosis provided a structure of more acceptable physical dimensions for these more diminutive patients. The orthosis showed no incipient sign of failure after 100,000 cycles of representative service loading equivalent to that imposed by a 20 kg (5-year-old) patient. The results of structural assessment and cyclic load testing confirm that the design of the orthosis sufficiently satisfies the statutory requirements for devices that are safe and fit for purpose to permit field trials with patients.",

        "Plasma-based sterilization is a promising alternative to the use of pure ethylene oxide (EO), for low-temperature clinical sterilization of medical instruments and devices. However, few studies have been published that evaluate its safety in terms of possible damage to materials, particularly polymers. The objective of this work was to evaluate polymer surface modifications induced by commercial plasma-based sterilizers, in comparison with pure EO: Samples from 5 polymer-based devices were subjected to 1, 5, and 10 sterilization cycles by Sterrad-100, Plazlyte, and pure EO. Surface analysis was carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), dynamic contact angle measurements (DCA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Surface oxidation and wettability changes were observed on all samples sterilized by plasma-based techniques, the degree of modifications depending on the sterilizer (Sterrad, Plazlyte) and the type of polymer. Drastic changes of surface appearance were also observed by SEM on PVC samples sterilized by Plazlyte and by pure EO. Possible repercussions on safety are discussed.",
        "In situ polymers are used by mixing two or more compounds that are then placed directly in tissues to form a unique product. This type of reaction can generate heat, reactive oxygen species, free radicals, and other by-products of unknown toxicities, but the polymer itself is biocompatible. Many regulatory agencies require in vitro testing, however, standard guidelines (ASTM, ISO, AAMI) test polymers in a final form prior to use as a medical device. To better estimate the cytotoxicity of these in situ polymers, various means of introducing the reacting material to cells in culture were explored. Coating the material on a sterile glass cover slip then adding the cover slip to the in vitro test system immediately provided reasonable cytotoxicity data that reflected actual use conditions. For in situ polymeric devices that are more viscous, such as dental materials and bone cements, a mold was used that was placed directly into cell culture. This approach in testing in situ polymers generated in vitro toxicity data that reflects the actual use of the material.",

        "Polyrotaxanes, in which alpha-cyclodextrins (alpha-CDs) are threaded onto poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(propylene glycol)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) triblock copolymers (Pluronic) capped with benzyloxycarbonyl(Z)-L-phenylalanine (Z-L-Phe), were prepared, and sulfopropyl groups were introduced to hydroxyl groups of alpha-CDs in the polyrotaxanes. The supramolecular structure and the chemical composition of the polyrotaxanes after the sulfonation were confirmed by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and elemental analysis. Anticoagulant activity of the polyrotaxanes and sulfonated polyrotaxanes was measured by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). It was found that the polyrotaxanes and the sulfonated polyrotaxanes showed greater anticoagulant activity than Pluronic itself, suggesting that both the supramolecular structure of the polyrotaxanes and the sulfonated groups contribute to the inhibition of intrinsic coagulation factors. Finally, our designed polyrotaxanes are suggested to be a promising candidate when fabricating blood-compatible medical devices by blending with or coating on clinically used polymers.",

        "Driven by economic and time constraints, some medical centers and third parties are resterilizing single-use devices (SUDs) for reuse. The steam autoclave is quick, but most plastics used in SUDs cannot survive the temperature. Thus, a number of new methods of cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing these complex devices are being introduced on the market. The present study investigated the effects of a range of methods on the tensile strength of latex rubber, silicone elastomer, 2 different formulations of polyurethane, nylon, and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) specimens. The methods used were sodium hypochlorite bleach (Clorox), peracetic acid + hydrogen peroxide (Steris), formaldehyde gas (Chemiclave), low-temperature peracetic acid and gas plasma (Plazlyte), and low-temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (Sterrad). The results showed that silicone elastomer was minimally affected, whereas the strengths of nylon, polyethylene, and latex were reduced by some of the methods. Depending on the formulation, the strength of polyurethane either increased or decreased. The data demonstrated that disinfection and sterilization can affect the tensile strength of certain materials used in medical devices.",
        "Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) has recently been established as a novel cell surface adhesion protein that binds with high affinity to fibronectin in the pericellular matrix. In this study, we have made use of this property to enhance the biocompatibility of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), a biomaterial currently used in bone repair. Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) discs were first coated with fibronectin and then tTG. The surface localisation of the two proteins was confirmed using ELISA and the tTG shown to be active on the surface by incorporation of biotin cadaverine into the fibronectin coating. When human osteoblasts (HOBs) were seeded onto the coated polymer surfaces in serum free medium, the surface coated with fibronectin and then tTG showed an increase in the spreading of the cells as compared to the surface coated with fibronectin alone, when analysed using environmental scanning electron microscopy. The presence of tTG had no effect on HOB cell differentiation when analysed by determining alkaline phosphatase activity. The use of tTG as a novel adhesion protein in this way may therefore have considerable potential in forming a stable tissue/biomaterial interface for application in medical devices.",

        "To estimate the feasibility of the subretinal concept of a visual prosthesis, animal models and prototypes, each representing a certain aspect of the final prosthesis, were utilised to test for requirements for such a medical device: (1) the ability to elicit--by electrical stimulation--event-related central activity in the central visual system, and (2) the long-term biocompatibility and biostability of the implant within the subretinal space.\n(1) In rabbit and Yucatan minipig, cortical evoked potentials were recorded with chronically implanted epidural electrodes during stimulation with light flashes as well as during electrical stimulation in the subretinal space. Voltage pulses ranging from -3 V to +3 V were applied via an acutely implanted electrode array on a wired prototype.

Fourteen months after implantation, angiography was performed and the histological findings of the retina in the immediate vicinity of the implant were evaluated.\n(1) In both rabbit and minipig, subretinal electrical stimulation resulted in evoked cortical potentials that were comparable to visual evoked potentials. The lowest threshold levels for the subretinal stimulation were 0.6 V for rabbits and 2 V for minipigs. (2) Long-term stability of an implanted MPDA and its biocompatibility were proven for a postoperative period of 14 months.\nData from animal experiments with certain prototypes of the final prosthesis suggest the feasibility of the concept of a subretinal visual prosthesis: Both requirements were met: (1) the functioning of the subretinal stimulation and (2) the biocompatibility of the MPDA implant.",

        "Bacteriologic studies of otitis media with effusion (OME) using highly sensitive techniques of molecular biology such as the polymerase chain reaction have demonstrated that traditional culturing methods are inadequate to detect many viable bacteria present in OME. The presence of pathogens attached to the middle-ear mucosa as a bacterial biofilm, rather than as free-floating organisms in a middle-ear effusion, has previously been suggested to explain these observations. The suggestion has been speculative, however, because no visual evidence of such biofilms on middle-ear mucosa has heretofore been collected. The hypotheses motivating the current study were: 1) biofilms of nontypable Hemophilus influenzae will form on the middle-ear mucosa of chinchillas in an experimental model of OME, 2) these biofilms will exhibit changes in density or structure over time, and 3) biofilms are also present on tympanostomy tubes in children with refractory post-tympanostomy otorrhea. The objective of this study was to collect visual evidence of the formation of bacterial biofilms in these situations.\nLaboratory study of bacteriology in an animal model and on medical devices removed from pediatric patients.\nExperimental otitis media was induced in chinchillas by transbullar injection of nontypable H. influenzae. Animals were killed in a time series and the surface of the middle-ear mucosa was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the presence of bacterial biofilms. Adult and fetal chinchilla uninfected controls were similarly examined for comparison. In addition, tympanostomy tubes that had been placed in children's ears to treat OME and removed after onset of refractory otorrhea or other problems were examined by SEM and by confocal scanning laser microscopy for bacterial biofilms, and compared with unused control tubes.\nBacterial biofilms were visually detected by SEM on the middle-ear mucosa of multiple chinchillas in which H. influenzae otitis media had been induced. Qualitative evaluation indicated that the density and thickness of the biofilm might increase until at least 96 hours after injection. The appearance of the middle-ear mucosa of experimental animals contrasted with that of uninjected control animals. Robust bacterial biofilms were also visually detected on tympanostomy tubes removed from children's ears for clinical reasons, in contrast with unused control tubes.\nBacterial biofilms form on the middle-ear mucosa of chinchillas in experimentally induced H. influenzae otitis media and can form on tympanostomy tubes placed in children's ears. Such biofilms can be directly observed by microscopy. These results reinforce the hypothesis that the bacterial aggregates called biofilms, resistant to treatment by antibiotics and to detection by standard culture techniques, may play a major etiologic role in OME and in one of its frequent complications, post-tympanostomy otorrhea.",

        "A bioartificial liver (BAL) is an extracorporeal medical device incorporating living hepatocytes in a cartridge. A variety of BALs have been developed and new devices are being introduced. Some of them have been clinically applied and from the results obtained they are claimed to be useful devices for assisting the liver functions of patients. However, there is still uncertainty as to their efficacy and their limitations are not clear. It is important to establish methods to quantitatively evaluate the metabolic and synthetic functions of BAL. In this paper, we derive simple equations for the quantitative evaluation of BAL functions on the basis of pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetics was originally developed to understand the processes of absorption, distribution, and elimination of administered drugs. Metabolic functions of the natural liver have been analyzed using pharmacokinetics and values of the useful parameters, clearance (CL) and intrinsic clearance (CLint), have been reported. The metabolic functions of the BAL expressed using values of CL and CLint are easily compared with those of the normal human liver. We believe that our method provides a useful basis for estimating the clinical effectiveness of BAL.",
        "Little is known about fungal biofilms, which may cause infection and antibiotic resistance. In this study, biofilm formation by different Candida species, particularly Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis, was evaluated by using a clinically relevant model of Candida biofilm on medical devices. Candida biofilms were allowed to form on silicone elastomer and were quantified by tetrazolium (XTT) and dry weight (DW) assays. Formed biofilm was visualized by using fluorescence microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy with Calcofluor White (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.), concanavalin A-Alexafluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.), and FUN-1 (Molecular Probes) dyes. Although minimal variations in biofilm production among invasive C. albicans isolates were seen, significant differences between invasive and noninvasive isolates (P < 0.001) were noted. C. albicans isolates produced more biofilm than C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis isolates, as determined by DW assays (P was <0.001 for all comparisons) and microscopy. Interestingly, noninvasive isolates demonstrated a higher level of XTT activity than invasive isolates. On microscopy, C. albicans biofilms had a morphology different from that of other species, consisting of a basal blastospore layer with a dense overlying matrix composed of exopolysaccharides and hyphae. In contrast, C. parapsilosis biofilms had less volume than C. albicans biofilms and were comprised exclusively of clumped blastospores. Unlike planktonically grown cells, Candida biofilms rapidly (within 6 h) developed fluconazole resistance (MIC, >128 microg/ml). Importantly, XTT and FUN-1 activity showed biofilm cells to be metabolically active. In conclusion, our data show that C. albicans produces quantitatively larger and qualitatively more complex biofilms than other species, in particular, C. parapsilosis.",
        "For a new treatment technology to become widely accepted in today's healthcare environment, the technology must not only be effective but also financially viable. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), a technology that enables radiation oncologists to precisely target and attack cancerous tumors with higher doses of radiation using strategically positioned beams while minimizing collateral damage to healthy cells, now meets both criteria. With IMRT, radiation oncologists for the first time have obtained the ability to divide the treatment field covered by each beam angle into hundreds of segments as small as 2.5 mm by 5 mm. Using the adjustable leaves of an MLC to shape the beam and by controlling exposure times, physicians can deliver a different dose to each segment and therefore modulate dose intensity across the entire treatment field. Development of optimal IMRT plans using conventional manual treatment planning methods would take days. To be clinically practical, IMRT required the development of \"inverse treatment planning\" software. With this software, a radiation oncologist can prescribe the ideal radiation dose for a specific tumor as well as maximum dose limits for surrounding healthy tissue. These numbers are entered into the treatment planning program which then calculates the optimal delivery approach that will best fit the oncologist's requirements. The radiation oncologist then reviews and approves the proposed treatment plan before it is initiated. The most recent advance in IMRT technology offers a \"dynamic\" mode or \"sliding window\" technique. In this more rapid delivery method, the beam remains on while the leaves of the collimator continually re-shape and move the beam aperture over the planned treatment area. This creates a moving beam that saturates the tumor volume with the desired radiation dose while leaving the surrounding healthy tissue in a protective shadow created by the leaves of the collimator. In the dynamic mode, an IMRT treatment session generally can be initiated and completed within the traditional 15-minute appointment window for radiation oncology clinics. In addition to being comforting for the patient, this rapid treatment delivery mode satisfies a key financial issue for hospitals and clinics by giving them the ability to handle high patient loads and achieve a more rapid return on their investment in an IMRT system. New IMRT reimbursement codes have been issued under the pass-through provisions of Medicare's Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), which authorize special or increased reimbursement levels for promising new developments in healthcare technology that previous reimbursement procedures did not address. These pass-through payments are generally applicable for defined periods during a promising new technology's early stage of adoption. In the case of codes G0174 and G0178, the effective period has been left open-ended. While the CMS adoption of these new IMRT reimbursement codes certainly paves the economic road for the diffusion of this technology by flattening out some of the economic obstacles, there are still bumps to overcome. The most obvious one is the investment in hardware and software that may be required. However, the added demands on staff and the cost of training cannot be ignored. IMRT is a treatment process involving FDA-approved medical devices, offering the hope of improved treatment outcomes with fewer complications for patients and higher reimbursement rates for hospital providers. By the end of the year 2001, there will probably be more than 75 hospitals with IMRT capabilities in place.",

        "The most significant complication in external fixation is pin tract infection causally related to the highly adaptive ability of bacteria to colonise the surfaces of \"inert\" biomaterials or of adjacent damaged tissue cells. The hypothesis that coating a pin with a silver-containing compound will decrease bacterial colonisation and/or pin tract infection has been confirmed in other studies in vitro and in vivo experiments. In this work, biocompatibility of silver-coated orthopaedic external fixation pins was compared with stainless steel controls in an in vitro study. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were used to assess the possible genotoxic effect of silver, studying the frequency of sister-chromatid exchanges and micronuclei while fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) and osteoblast-like cells were used for cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility studies. These studies have shown that silver is neither genotoxic nor cytotoxic as compared to stainless steel, a material in wide use as a metal implant. At 4 days cells cultured on the silver-coated material evidenced good cell spreading and a higher cell count with respect to the uncoated material. It appears that the addition of silver onto implantable medical devices could be beneficial when specific biological properties, such as antibacterial behaviour, are required. Based on these and the previous bacterial studies it seems like the toxicity towards bacteria was quite a bit greater than that towards the human cells.",
        "Concern over electromagnetic interference with medical devices due to cell phone emissions has stemmed from anecdotal reports and unpublished observations of hospital staff. In an effort to characterize electromagnetic interference concerns, representative medical devices from four large teaching hospitals were exposed to standard North American and European communication signal emissions. Of 33 medical devices tested, only 4 showed disruption of critical function due to cell phone emissions at a distance of 25 cm or greater. Although other cases of electromagnetic interference were observed, these were not critically disruptive and mainly occurred when the transmitters were at full power and placed 5 cm or closer to the medical device. Overall, no cell phone signal was exempt from producing electromagnetic interference effects. While sensitive medical devices were often affected by more than one signal type, the effects were not entirely predictable based upon the results of other signals or related medical device units or models. Because a comprehensive analysis of all medical devices in all possible electromagnetic environments was not performed, the data presented here are only intended to provide a general idea of the magnitude of electromagnetic interference effects that might be encountered in a hospital environment, as well as a standard protocol for clinical engineering groups to perform ad hoc electromagnetic interference surveys and methods to manage and/or eliminate electromagnetic interference with appropriate system engineering design including supplementary communication infrastructure, medical device shielding and positioning, and appropriate cell phone user guidelines.",
        "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of repeated ethylene oxide sterilization using a standard clinical protocol on sutures, a type of medical device labeled for single use and reported to be reprocessed for use after being opened but not used. Four types of commonly used synthetic absorbable sutures were subjected to 1 and 2 ethylene oxide resterilization cycles. Knot tensile strength was determined for new sutures and for sutures that had been subjected to 1 and 2 ethylene oxide resterilization cycles. As has been found with other types of single-use devices, no general conclusions can be made for absorbable sutures. The strengths of different types of sutures increased, decreased, or stayed the same after repeated sterilization. In addition, the inner packages of some sutures were not intact after reprocessing, possibly exposing the sutures to increased humidity, which can produce degradation leading to loss of strength both immediately and after additional shelf aging and degraded performance after clinical use.",

        "Micro-organisms may be transmitted by medical devices. A large variety of infectious agents may be involved in infections transmitted by endoscopic procedures. We review a series of examples that demonstrate to what extent micro-organisms can be detected on medical devices and how transmission on to subsequently examined persons due to inadequate reprocessing can occur. Hardly any data are available regarding residuals of process chemicals, although numerous published cases of glutaraldehyde-related colitis demonstrate that this issue requires urgent clarification. A risk of endoscope contamination exists, interalia, if washer-disinfectors are technically defective or are incorrectly operated. In particular, a final rinse water of poor microbiological quality can lead to recontamination of endoscopes.",

        "Therapies directed toward stimulation of angiogenesis seek to accelerate the development of new blood vessels in tissues rendered dysfunctional because of an insufficient microvascular supply. The goal of the current study was the stimulation of an angiogenic response around and within porous biomedical implants, such as vascular grafts, constructed from a base polymer composed of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). Similar to many biomaterials, ePTFE does not elicit a significant angiogenic response and the porous interstices of this material remain avascular after implantation. Studies were performed to evaluate the ability of a tumorigenic cell line, the 804-G rat kidney cell to secrete an angiogenic extracellular matrix on and within the porous structures of ePTFE. A rat model was used to evaluate and compare implant-associated healing responses between nonmodified materials and extracellular matrix-modified ePTFE. Results demonstrated that, in contrast to untreated ePTFE, the matrix-modified ePTFE stimulated both angiogenesis in implant-associated tissue and neovascularization of the pores within the ePTFE interstices. Deposition of an insoluble matrix stimulates an angiogenic response and has a potential application for the improvement of medical device function.",
        "The excellent biocompatibility of titanium and its alloys used, for example, for medical devices, is associated with the properties of their surface oxide. For a better understanding of the tissue reaction in contact with the oxide layer, knowledge of the chemical and physical properties of this layer is of increasing interest. In this study, titania films were produced on cp-Ti and Ti6Al4V substrates by thermal oxidation, anodic oxidation, and by the sol-gel process. The thickness and structure of the films produced under different conditions were determined by ellipsometry, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurements. The corrosion properties of these layers were investigated by current density-potential curves under physiological conditions. The oxide layers produced on cp-Ti and Ti6Al4V by thermal oxidation consist of TiO(2) in the rutile structure. For the anodized samples the structure of TiO(2) is a mixture of amorphous phase and anatase. The structure of the coatings produced by the sol-gel process for a constant annealing time depends on the annealing temperature, and with increasing temperature successively amorphous, anatase, and rutile structure is observed. Compared to the uncoated, polished substrate with a natural oxide layer, the corrosion resistance of cp-Ti and Ti6Al4V is increased for the samples with an oxide layer thickness of about 100 nm, independent of the oxidation procedure.",
        "To determine the utility of routine chest radiographs (CXRs) in clinical decision-making in the intensive care unit (ICU).\nA prospective evaluation of CXRs performed in the ICU for a period of 6 months. A questionnaire was completed for each CXR performed, addressing the indication for the radiograph, whether it changed the patient's management, and how it did so.\nA 14-bed medical-surgical ICU in a university-affiliated, tertiary care hospital.\nA total of 645 CXRs were analyzed in 97 medical patients and 205 CXRs were analyzed in 101 surgical patients.\nOf the 645 CXRs performed in the medical patients, 127 (19.7%) led to one or more management changes. In the 66 surgical patients with an ICU stay <48 hours, 15.4% of routine CXRs changed management. In 35 surgical patients with an ICU stay > or = 48 hours, 26% of the 100 routine films changed management. In both the medical and surgical patients, the majority of changes were related to an adjustment of a medical device.\nRoutine CXRs have some value in guiding management decisions in the ICU. Daily CXRs may not, however, be necessary for all patients.",
        "The extent to which the medical device manufacturers are responsible for actively monitoring the performance of their products after they have successfully passed the rigorous pre-market approval process has always been a matter of diverse opinion. Within Europe, the law is unhelpfully vague on this point. While there are some comparatively clear obligations for reporting incidents to the authorities (known as the 'vigilance system'), little detail is given on how diligently the manufacturer should try to find out about such incidents. In the early stages of the European Community Directives covering medical devices, there was much emphasis upon formulating guidance to help interpret the vigilance reporting requirements. It is, however, only recently that attention has turned to attempting to clarify what is expected from post-marketing surveillance (PMS) in its broader sense. This article discuses both the vigilance and PMS processes and outlines the currently available European, and particularly UK, guidance documents which are aimed at promoting a more level playing field across industry where these activities are concerned. In particular, it explains the principle differences between vigilance and post-marketing surveillance: the former being the reporting of adverse incidents by manufacturers to the regulatory authorities and their subsequent sharing of key incident data between each other; the latter being the process by which information on overall devise performance is captured, analysed and acted upon. Nevertheless, it is still a struggle to gain widespread appreciation that these two activities are not in fact one and the same.",

        "Following a statement by the UK Medical Devices Agency (MDA), soya-oil-filled Trilucent implants for breast augmentation were withdrawn from sale in March 1999. The most recent report on the toxicity of the Trilucent implant suggests that one of the breakdown products of the filler is an aldehyde with an explicit risk of genotoxic and teratogenic effects. Explantation of all these prostheses was advised by the MDA in June 2000. No guidance regarding capsulectomy was put forward by any publication. The operation of capsulectomy confers an increased morbidity compared with simple prosthetic replacement. This study looks at the capsules of 18 consecutive patients who had received Trilucent implants for cosmetic breast augmentation, and who had undergone explantation and capsulectomy. The mean duration of implantation was 3 years (range: 2 years to 4 years 9 months). The capsules were examined histologically. The significant features of all the capsules included a florid foreign-body type reaction, synovial metaplasia, a villous hyperplasia and the presence of refractile material within the substance of the capsule. It is postulated that the refractile material is filler material that has bled through the wall of the intact Trilucent implant, and as such would represent a potential genotoxic hazard. Until such time as this potential hazard has been investigated fully and a conclusion reached, we recommend acceptance of the increased morbidity, and the performance of capsulectomies when explanting Trilucent implants.",

        "Cytapheresis has been investigated recently for the treatment of autoimmune related diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis, and so on. A large number of physicians have indicated that patients with autoimmune diseases respond to cytapheresis treatment. The effective mechanism of cytapheresis for immune disorders is still controversial. However, the removal of the leukocyte including granulocyte, lymphocyte, and monocyte may play a crucial role in correcting imbalance of the immune system. A session of cytapheresis including leukocytapheresis (LCAP) and granulocytapheresis (GCAP) may not create a sufficient amount of cell removal for the human body. However, the cell removal can be a trigger of the immunomodulation as the treatment for immune disorder. Furthermore, not only cell removal but also reaction by blood contacting with medical device materials may play a role as an immunomodulation for immune disorders. This review introduces current cytapheresis technologies and attempts to elucidate the effective mechanism of cytapheresis for immune disorders, focused on LCAP and/or GCAP for RA or IBD.",

        "A postal questionnaire on 'sterilization and disinfection' was sent to all 144 nurse members of the British Association of Health Services in Higher Education (BAHSHE). Forty-nine (34%) completed valid questionnaires were returned. Despite the majority of practices performing minor surgical procedures such as cervical cytology (N= 40, 82%), ear syringing (N= 44, 90%) and wound dressing (N= 49, 100%), only 11 (22%) had access to a sterile supply department (SSD), and the definitions of sterilization and disinfection were only identified by 23 (52%) and 14 (32%) of the respondents, respectively. Forty-one (84%) respondents had a benchtop sterilizer (30 had a benchtop sterilizer, 11 a vacuum sterilizer and two had both), although there was considerable confusion on their appropriate use and maintenance. Just over half had written procedures for sterilizer use, no practice changed the sterilizer water on a daily basis as recommended by the Medical Devices Agency (MDA), few kept a sterilizer logbook and even fewer had read the MDA Device Bulletin on benchtop sterilizers. The majority of respondents voiced an interest in attending a workshop on sterilization and disinfection. We conclude that despite the location of the general practices within an academic environment, the concept of infection control is clearly not understood by university health service staff. As the implications of a failure to implement proper infection control procedures are potentially serious, the need for adequate education and training of staff is of critical importance.",

        "By incorporating techniques adapted from the microelectronics industry, the field of microfabrication has allowed the creation of microneedles, which have the potential to improve existing biological-laboratory and medical devices and to enable novel devices for gene and drug delivery. Dense arrays of microneedles have been used to deliver DNA into cells. Many cells are treated at once, which is much more efficient than current microinjection techniques. Microneedles have also been used to deliver drugs into local regions of tissue. Microfabricated neural probes have delivered drugs into neural tissue while simultaneously stimulating and recording neuronal activity, and microneedles have been inserted into arterial vessel walls to deliver anti-restenosis drugs. Finally, microhypodermic needles and microneedles for transdermal drug delivery have been developed to reduce needle insertion pain and tissue trauma and to provide controlled delivery across the skin. These needles have been shown to be robust enough to penetrate skin and dramatically increase skin permeability to macromolecules.",

These objects can have miniature moving parts, stationary structures, or both. Microfabrication has been used for many applications in biology and medicine. These applications fall into four domains: tools for molecular biology and biochemistry, tools for cell biology, medical devices, and biosensors. Microfabricated device structures may provide significantly enhanced function with respect to a conventional device. Sometimes microfabrication can enable devices with novel capabilities. These enhancing and enabling qualities are conferred when microfabrication is used appropriately to address the right types of problems. Herein, we describe microfabrication technology and its application to biology and medicine. We detail several classes of advantages conferred by microfabrication and how these advantages have been used to date.",

        "The effects of advertising on urological practice are controversial. We studied patterns of pharmaceutical and medical device marketing in peer reviewed urological journals in 1975 and 2000.\nPharmaceutical and medical device advertising in 1 European and 2 American peer reviewed urological journals were evaluated in 4 randomly selected issues of each journal published in 1975 and 2000, respectively. Advertising quantity and the qualitative characteristics of each advertisement were analyzed.\nWe analyzed 574 advertisements in 24 issues. Advertising decreased between 1975 and 2000 based on the number of pages per issue (55.3 to 31.9, p = 0.04), number of advertisements per issue (30.4 to 17.4, p = 0.0098) and the ratio of advertising-to-scientific pages (0.399 to 0.151, p = 0.0016). Mean advertisement length was stable at 1.8 pages. The top 3 advertisers in 1975 were Eaton, Roche and Warner compared with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Merck in 2000. Advertising for antibiotics comprised 70.3% of all pharmaceutical advertisements in 1975 but only 15.2% in 2000 (p = 0.0001), while advertising for benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction and hormonal therapy increased sharply. Nutritional supplement marketing increased from 0.5% of all advertisements in 1975 to 4.3% in 2000 (p = 0.0026). The incidence of advertisements citing peer reviewed literature increased from 16.7% to 33% (p = 0.0001) with a greater increase in the European than in the American journals.\nAdvertising in peer reviewed urological journals has decreased since 1975 and fewer companies now market more products. Few advertisements cite the scientific literature. Better understanding of pharmaceutical marketing patterns may improve awareness of these efforts to influence physician practice.",
        "This article reviews our studies on evaluating the suitability of high-performance immunoaffinity chromatography (HPIAC), an immunoaffinity membrane (IAM) for removing unwanted plasma component, and the safety of the IAM. In an attempt to resolve the problem of amyloid deposition in dialysis patients, we used an HPIAC column, bearing anti-beta 2-microglobulin to remove specifically beta 2-MG from human plasma. The use of a membrane as an affinity ligand support was also studied. A specific antibody immobilized on the membrane was highly effective for the removal of rat immunoglobulin E and of a human serum amyloid P component passed through an extracorporeal circulation (EC) system. Biocompatibility of the specific antibody-bearing IAM was also examined. These techniques should prove useful for medical applications and may have broad applicability to the elimination of any unwanted plasma component. The IAM exerts two functions simultaneously, usual dialysis and elimination by immunoaffinity binding. The rat EC model has been applied as an evaluation system for the safety of medical devices in contact with the blood stream. Combining commonly used hemodialysis (HD) membranes with rat EC, we evaluated the elicitation of immunological responses, as well as the effect of repeated EC. The data suggest that this EC model can reproduce similar immunological responses in HD patients, and can be employed to evaluate medical devices and materials for their delayed, systemic, and repeated exposure effects. The EC system described here can reproduce human HD treatment, remove unwanted substances, and evaluate medical devices and materials for toxicological responses.",

The injectable silicone conformed to European Economic Community standards and was accepted by the Medical Devices Agency (UK). The subjects were equally divided between male and female. Two randomly divided groups received silicone (n = 16) and sterile saline (n = 15). Total volumes used were not identical between the groups of subjects (p = .05), although the maximum volume was no greater than 1.5 ml in any subject. The effectiveness of the injection was reviewed using a Harris-Beath ink mat, visual analogue scale, alteration in frequency of treatment, and subjective analysis of reduction in lesions before and after by color photography. Essential histopathology was undertaken on 11 subjects. Granulomatous reactions were only positively identified in one case. Nine matched pairs showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatments (p = .082) using parametric and nonparametric tests. This study found no evidence to show that small quantities of medically prepared liquid silicone caused adverse reactions, although two cases were more sensitive after injection of silicone.",
        "Implantation of any medical device normally causes an inflammatory cell interaction with the foreign material. In vitro cell activation of human neutrophils (Mac-1 upregulation) has been taken as one measure to assess the attributable risk of inflammation due to biopolymers before their clinical application. Mac-1 expression has generally been measured by flow cytometric assays, whereas quantification of neutrophil adhesion to the biopolymer surfaces has been performed by separate and time-consuming assays, e.g. microscopically by differential cell counting. However, due to an increasing number of surface-modified novel biopolymers entering clinical usage, effective testing of their inflammatory potential is now mandatory. To facilitate these analyses, we have developed a novel flow cytometric assay permitting simultaneous measurement of biopolymer-mediated neutrophil activation and adhesion. The biopolymers were used as beads (diameter 25+/-10 microm), and were demonstrated to be non-phagocytosable and non-fluorescent before being co-incubated with whole human blood (range of ratio granulocytes/beads from 5:1 to 1:1). Besides flow cytometric measurement of Mac-1 up-regulated neutrophils as fluorescing events, a fluorescence of the bead population indicates the adherence of activated neutrophils to the biopolymer surface.After establishing this assay, we evaluated it by comparing six different biopolymers. We observed high levels of Mac-1 expression (>70% of positive control) accompanied by increased adhesiveness (>60% of neutrophils) for polyurethane (PUR), polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA), and poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA) beads. Low Mac-1 expression levels (<10%) accompanied by a low percentage of adhering neutrophils (<10%) were observed for polyethylene (PE), polyisoprene (PI), and silicone (SI) beads.",
        "Despite an increased understanding of the pathogenesis of NP and advances in diagnosis and treatment, the risk, cost, morbidity, and mortality of NP remain unacceptably high. This article has identified strategic areas for primary and secondary prophylaxis that are simple and cost-effective. Realizing that the pathogenesis of NP requires bacterial colonization and the subsequent entry of these bacteria into the lower respiratory tree helps highlight the role of cross-infection and the importance of standard infection control procedures. Similarly the role of sedation and devices as risk factors can be reduced by minimizing the duration and intensity of sedation and length of exposure to invasive devices. Additional low-cost interventions that have been shown to be effective in preventing NP are the positioning of patients in a semirecumbent position and the appropriate use of enteral feeding, antibiotics, and selected medical devices. Prophylaxis of NP and VAP is carried out best by a multidisciplinary management team comprised of physicians (critical care, pulmonary medicine, infectious diseases, and primary care), critical care and infection control nurses, and respiratory therapists, even though this approach may result in decreased professional autonomy and freedom. This group should review the current guidelines, pathways, and standards for short-term and long-term prophylaxis of NP and VAP, then integrate them into and monitor their use for routine patient care. The risk factors and prophylaxis strategies for NP discussed in this article apply primarily to patients in acute care facilities, but also are relevant to alternative health care settings as well as the care of ill patients in ambulatory settings. The routine use of effective team policies for prophylaxis needs to be monitored by the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Care or other agencies. Research to delineate the most effective and feasible strategies for prophylaxis NP has been compromised by insufficient funding and lack of adequate, randomized multicenter studies to enable generalizability of results. Effective strategies for prophylaxis have not been disseminated widely or implemented in hospitals. Successful short-term and long-term strategies for prophylaxis must be evaluated and implemented by a team of physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists. More than 100 years ago, Sir William Osler warned health care providers, \"Remember how much you don't know.\" The authors would add that clinicians have acquired significant knowledge about risk factors and prophylaxis of NP in the 1980s and 1990s, but prophylaxis as a theory rather than an action. If the tree has not been planted, the time is now.",
        "Long-term suppressive antimicrobial therapy is an alternative treatment choice in patients with medical device-related infection who are not eligible for surgical device removal for attempted cure. There is a paucity of data published that examines this treatment option.\nMembers of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Emerging Infections Network were polled to identify patients with intravascular device-related infections who were not candidates for surgery and were given long-term antimicrobial therapy to suppress clinical manifestations of infection.\nClinical and microbiologic data were collected retrospectively for 51 patients. Sixty-nine percent of patients were men; vascular grafts were the most common type of medical device infected [30 (58.8%) patients]. Sixty-three percent (32 of 51) of cases involved gram-positive cocci. A variety of antimicrobials were administered as chronic suppressive therapy, with beta-lactams used most frequently (39.2%). Therapy ranged from 3 months to 10 years. Three (7.32%) of 41 patients in whom follow-up data were available developed relapsing infection while on long-term suppressive therapy. Three other patients suffered drug adverse events.\nOverall, long-term suppressive therapy was well-tolerated and efficacious in preventing signs of infection relapse.",
        "While chemotherapy-related toxicities affect cancer patients' activities of daily living and result in large expenditures of medical care for treatment, few studies have assessed the out-of-pocket and indirect costs incurred by patients who experience toxicity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining detailed and comprehensive cost information from patients who experienced neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or neurotoxicity during treatment.\nOvarian cancer patients who experienced chemotherapy-associated hematologic or neurologic toxicities were asked to record detailed information about hospitalization, laboratories, physician visits, phone calls, home visits, medication, medical devices, lost productivity, and caregivers. Resource estimates were converted into cost units, with direct medical cost estimates based on hospital cost-accounting data and indirect costs (i.e., productivity loss) on modified labor force, employment, and earnings data.\nDirect medical costs were highest for neutropenia (mean of $7,546/episode), intermediate for thrombocytopenia (mean of $3,268/episode), and lowest for neurotoxicity (mean of $688/episode). Indirect costs relating to patient and caregiver work loss and payments for caregiver support were substantial, accounting for $4,220, $3,834, and $4,282 for patients who developed neurotoxicity, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. The total costs of chemotherapy-related neurotoxicity, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were $4,908, $11,830, and $7,550.\nOur study has shown that, with the assistance of patients who are experiencing toxicity, estimation of the total costs of cancer-related toxicities is feasible. Indirect costs, while not included in prior estimates of the costs of toxicity studies, accounted for 34% to 86% of the total costs of cancer supportive care.",

        "The leachability of both Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and Tri(2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TEHTM) or Trioctyl trimellitate (TOTM) from haemodialysis tubing was investigated in 20 patients with chronic renal failure undergoing maintenance haemodialysis. The blood tubing made of common polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plasticized with DEHP (group 1 patients) were replaced with tubing plasticized with TOTM-DEHP (group 2 patients). The patient blood obtained from the inlet and the outlet of the dialyzer was analyzed during a 4 h-dialysis session. Thus, the circulating concentrations of both DEHP and TOTM resulting from the release from dialyzer tubes were estimated using High-performance Liquid chromatograph (HPLC). With the common PVC-DEHP blood tubing, a DEHP quantity of 122.95+/-33.94 mg was extracted from tubing during a single dialysis session (ranging from 55 to 166.21 mg). During the same period, the total amounts of DEHP retained by the patients were 27.30+/-9.22 mg (ranging from 12.50 to 42.72 mg). As for blood tubing plasticized with TOTM-DEHP, 41.80+/-4.47 mg of DEHP and 75.11+/-25.72 mg of TOTM were extracted. During the same period, the amounts of DEHP and TOTM retained by the patients were 3.42+/-1.37 mg and 4.87+/-2.60 mg, respectively. The extraction rate both plasticizers was correlated with serum lipid content (cholesterol+triglyceride) (r(2)=0.75 for DEHP and r(2)=0.64 for TOTM). In the present investigation, less TOTM and DEHP were apparently released from haemodialysis tubing plasticized with TOTM-DEHP than DEHP released from haemodialysis tubing plasticized with DEHP only. TOTM seems to be a superior alternative to DEHP for use in medical devices because of its potential lower leachability. To recommend it as an alternative plasticizer, its possible toxicity towards human body should be investigated before it can be used routinely. However, patients undergoing haemodialysis using tubing plasticized with DEHP only are regularly exposed to non negligible amounts of DEHP. In view of several biological effects previously reported, it is time to reconsider the use of DEHP only as a plasticizer.",
        "Staphylococcus epidermidis is a major cause of infections associated with indwelling medical devices. Biofilm production is an important virulence attribute in the pathogenesis of device-related infections. Therefore, elimination of these biofilms is an ideal treatment. Salicylate (5 mM) combined with 1 microg of vancomycin per ml inhibited biofilm formation by S. epidermidis (RP62A) by >or=99.9%. When biofilm-coated polystyrene beads were exposed to 5 mM sodium salicylate and 4 microg of vancomycin per ml (one-half the minimum biofilm eradication concentration), there was a >99.9% reduction in viable count.",

        "A case-control study was conducted among 205 women in Michigan and Ohio who were diagnosed with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) to investigate the significance of self-reported past exposures to implanted silicone-containing or non-silicone-containing medical devices. The 205 UCTD cases were compared with 2,095 controls who were sampled by random digit dialing. When silicone-containing devices, including shunts and catheters, were analyzed collectively, a significant association was observed (odds ratio (OR) = 2.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34, 5.89). The odds ratio for exposure to breast implants was increased, but not significantly (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 0.65, 7.57). Among the non-silicone-containing devices, artificial joints (OR = 5.01, 95% CI: 1.60, 15.71) and orthopedic metallic fixation devices (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.05, 3.60) were associated with UCTD. The estimations of risk associated with implanted medical devices in UCTD cases were explored in a comparison with 660 scleroderma patients who were ascertained concurrently in Michigan and Ohio. In general, the associations that were observed with non-silicone-containing devices, and more specifically with the fixation devices, persisted in the comparison of UCTD cases with scleroderma patients. The studies conducted among populations in Michigan and Ohio are intended to stimulate new hypotheses, innovative approaches, and the fostering of understanding of the environmental determinants of autoimmune disease.",
        "Medical devices are responsible for a large portion of nosocomial infections, particularly in critically ill patients. Device-associated infections can cause major medical and economic sequelae. Bacterial colonization of the indwelling device can be a prelude to both infection and malfunction of the device. The pathogenesis of device-associated infection centers around the multifaceted interaction among the bacteria, the device, and the host. Bacterial factors are probably the most important in pathogenesis of infection, whereas device factors are the most amenable to modification with the objective of preventing infection. Some, but not all, of the studied bacterial receptors satisfy the proposed \"adherence/infection\" version of Koch's postulates. Traditional surface-modifying preventive approaches have largely focused on antimicrobial coating of devices and resulted in variable clinical success in preventing device-associated infections. The potential protective role of newer innovative approaches, such as biofilm modification and bacterial interference, ought to be further investigated.",
        "To evaluate the potential use of cilostazol in intracoronary stenting.\nClinical literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-March 2001). Key search terms included cilostazol, intracoronary stenting, and coronary angioplasty. Abstracts of clinical trials presented at major cardiology professional association meetings were also reviewed.\nIntracoronary stent placement represents the fastest growing medical device implant. Complications of stent implantation include acute and subacute vessel closure, as well as late restenosis. Currently, antiplatelet agents are used for preventive therapy. Cilostazol is a vasodilating antiplatelet agent that reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by many factors. In seven randomized trials comparing cilostazol with either aspirin or ticlopidine, cilostazol was found to be superior to aspirin and equivalent to ticlopidine in decreasing both cardiac events and rates of restenosis. In addition, cilostazol was found to be well tolerated, with no reports of adverse hematologic events.\nAlthough further comparative trials are required, cilostazol appears to be a safe and effective alternative to clopidogrel and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists following intracoronary stent implantation.",
        "This study details all incidents involving medical devices used in anaesthesia and intensive care reported to the relevant authorities in France in 1998. There were 1004 reports during that year. Incidents were classified as serious (harmful to patients) in 11% of cases; death resulted in 2% of cases. Equipment for ventilation and infusion, and monitors of all kinds, accounted for most of the reports, representing 37%, 30% and 12%, respectively, of all reports. The leading causes of failure varied according to the category of device. User errors, quality control problems during production of the device and design faults were the three main causes. The problems identified during the study period enabled the faulty medical devices to be improved in 12-44% of cases. We conclude that post-marketing vigilance is a useful way of improving the quality of medical devices.",
        "Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is a commonly prescribed medicine in hospitalized patients, but its adverse effects on older patients remain unclear.\nWe enrolled 426 hospitalized medical patients aged 70 years or older in a prospective cohort study in a university hospital. Measurements included baseline and daily assessments including Mini-Mental State Examination scores, Confusion Assessment Method ratings, direct observations for medical devices (urinary catheter or physical restraints), and blinded medical record extractions for diphenhydramine use.\nOf the 426 patients, 114 (27%) received diphenhydramine during hospitalization and shared similar baseline characteristics including age, sex, delirium risk, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores compared with nonexposed patients. The diphenhydramine-exposed group was at an increased risk for any delirium symptoms (relative risk [RR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-2.3) and for individual delirium symptoms, including inattention (RR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.5-5.9), disorganized speech (RR, 5.5; 95% CI, 1.0-29.8), and altered consciousness (RR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.6-6.1). Exposed patients also had increased risk for urinary catheter placement (RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-6.0) and longer median length of stay (7 vs 6 days; P =.009). A dose-response relationship was demonstrated for most adverse outcomes. Overall, 24% of diphenhydramine doses were administered inappropriately.\nDiphenhydramine administration in older hospitalized patients is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and other adverse effects with a dose-response relationship. Careful review of its use is necessary in this vulnerable population.",
        "The insertion of implants and medical devices has emerged as a common and often life-saving procedure. A current estimate of the rate of total hip replacement in the world is approximately one million a year, and knee replacements more than 250000. More than 30% of hospitalized patients have one or more vascular catheters in place. More than 10% of hospitalized patients have an indwelling urinary catheter. Some patients require multiple joint replacements. In the United States, approximately 2 million nosocomial infections cost nearly $11 billion annually. Exposure to invasive medical devices is one of the most important risk factors.(1)Devices predispose to infection by damaging or invading epithelial or mucosal barriers and by supporting growth of micro-organisms, thus serving as reservoirs. Invasive medical devices impair host defence mechanisms and, when contaminated, can result in resistant chronic infection or tissue necrosis, the major objections to extended use of implant devices. Implant devices today account for approximately 45% of all nosocomial infections.(2)Implant infections are extremely resistant to antibiotics and host defences and frequently persist until the implant is removed, which is the standard therapy. Tissue damage caused by surgery and foreign body implantation further increases the susceptibility to infections, activates host defences and stimulates the generation of inflammatory mediators; these are enhanced by bacterial activity and toxins.(3)The ability of bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are otherwise virtually avirulent, to escape from host defences and antibiotic therapy, has led to the development of alternative methods of control such as infection-resistant materials acting as antimicrobial drug-delivery systems. By these methods, there is a sustained delivery of antimicrobial drugs into the local micro-environment of implants, which avoids systemic side-effects and exceeds usual systemic concentrations by several orders of magnitude. Bioengineering of hybrid implant materials in order to achieve optimal performance and to prevent inflammatory reactions and interface cellular disorganization is a field undergoing rapid development. Hybrid materials that slowly deliver antimicrobial drugs may reduce implant infections in the future.",

The regulation of devices follows the 'New Approach' policy of the EC Commission and involves more self-regulation and conformity assessment. The controls are relatively recent beginning in 1993 for Active Implantable Devices and concluding with the In Vitro Diagnostic Directive implemented in June 2000. The article describes how the directives have been implemented in the UK, the role of the Notified Bodies and the role of the Medical Device Agency (MDA) as the competent authority. In particular the Agency's compliance and standards work is described along with the strategy and post marketing surveillance and adverse incident scheme. The MDA is a key international device regulatory agency and its international role is discussed. So too is its device evaluation programme for the NHS and how this complements the work of NICE.

        "Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in the environment and cause colonization, infection, and pseudo-outbreaks in health care settings. Data suggest that the frequency of nosocomial outbreaks due to NTM may be increasing, and reduced hot water temperatures may be partly responsible for this phenomenon. Attention to adequate high-level disinfection of medical devices and the use of sterile reagents and biologicals will prevent most outbreaks. Because NTM cannot be eliminated from the hospital environment, and because they present an ongoing potential for infection, NTM should be considered in all cases of nosocomial infection, and careful surveillance must be used to identify potential outbreaks. Analysis of the species of NTM and the specimen source may assist in determining the significance of a cluster of isolates. Once an outbreak or pseudo-outbreak is suspected, molecular techniques should be applied promptly to determine the source and identify appropriate control measures.",

The Foleycath was the most difficult for the physician to use and required significantly more time to position correctly. The Goldstein catheter was the best tolerated by the patients. The Foleycath was the cheapest whereas the PBN Balloon was the most expensive.\nThe choice of the catheter must be targeted to achieving a good balance between tolerability for the patients, efficacy, cost, and the personal preference of the operator.",
        "Infection by Staphylococcus epidermidis, an opportunistic pathogen, has become a major problem due to the increased use of implanted medical devices and the growing number of patients who are therapeutically or infectiously immunosuppressed. These infections appear to proceed via modulation of the coagulation and complement systems. In this communication we describe the purification and characterization of a novel extracellular proteinase from an oral strain of S. epidermidis that can degrade fibrinogen, complement protein C5, and several other proteins. This proteinase has a strong preference for cleavage after glutamic acid residues, but not after aspartic acid. The S. epidermidis enzyme may be a multifunctional protein which not only provides this organism with both the ability to evade the complement defense system and to dysregulate the coagulation cascade, but also supplies nutrients for its growth through the degradation of Glu-rich proteins.",
        "Human implant technologies are subject to continual innovation and proliferation, raising important issues for technology testing, healthcare sciences, clinical performance and risk assessment, and regulation. The regulatory environment of medical devices is being shaped by harmonisation of standards in the European Union. The aim of this paper is to compare the histories and current regulatory environment of two technologies, breast implants and artificial hips, and to consider the implications of this comparison for a sociological healthcare research agenda to investigate the issues raised. The main focus is upon developments in the United Kingdom. Major points of contrast between the two technologies include the institutional contexts in which clinical evidence has been marshalled for government attention; the relative importance of strategic alliances between clinicians and manufacturers in the innovation process; the degree of public controversy evident; the varying definitions of an 'adverse incident' within medical device vigilance systems; and in the UK the presence of a national register for breast implants but not for hip implants. Inter-national contrasts in these dimensions are noted. The analysis suggests that improved understanding is required of the institutional, organisational and professional processes involved in implant technology innovation and regulation. A comparative research agenda is proposed, focusing upon: innovativeness and proliferation; safety and technological standards; clinical and social outcomes; and consumer/user information and choice. It is concluded that research in these areas will enhance the 'evidence-base' for the evaluation of human implant technologies in the context of their innovatory and regulatory environments.",
        "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common disease that affects up to 1% of the population, and causes significant morbidity and early mortality. The aetiology of RA is unknown; however, in the last 10 to 15 years significant advances in molecular technology have provided a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. This has led to the development of new approaches to the treatment of RA. The disease modifying antirheumatic oral agent leflunomide inhibits the proliferation of activated T cells that are important in the inflammation and degradation of synovial tissues. The 2 biological agents approved for the treatment of RA, infliximab and etanercept, are inhibitors of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha). Infliximab is a chimeric human/mouse monoclonal antibody which is administered by intravenous infusion and binds with high affinity to TNFalpha, thereby neutralising its effects. Etanercept is a recombinant, soluble TNF receptor molecule which is administered subcutaneously and binds to TNFalpha in the serum rendering it biologically inactive. The protein A immunoadsorption column is a medical device that in conjunction with plasmapheresis can be used in patients with refractory RA. These agents have provided new and effective therapies for the treatment of patients with RA.",
        "Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a biocompatible and resorbable implant material. For these reasons, it has been used for the fabrication of temporary stents, bone plates, nails and screws (Peng et al. Biomaterials 1996;17:685). In some cases, the brittle mechanical properties of PHB homopolymer limit its application. A typical plasticizer, triethylcitrate (TEC), was used to overcome such limitations by making the material more pliable. In the past few years, CO2-laser cutting of PHB was used in the manufacturing of small medical devices such as stents. Embrittlement of plasticized PHB tubes has been observed, after laser machining. Consequently, the physicochemical and morphological properties of laser-processed surfaces and cut edges of plasticized polymer samples were examined to determine the extent of changes in polymer properties as a result of laser machining. These studies included determination of the depth of the laser-induced heat affected zone by polariscopy of thin polymer sections. Molecular weight changes and changes in the TEC content as a function of distance from the laser-cut edge were determined. In a preliminary test, the cellular response to the processed material was investigated by cell culture study of L929 mouse fibroblasts on laser-machined surfaces. The heat-affected zone was readily classified into four different regions with a total depth of about 60 to 100 microm (Klamp, Master Thesis, University of Rostock, 1998). These results correspond well with the chemical analysis and molecular weight measurements. Furthermore, it was found that cells grew preferentially on the laser-machined area. These findings have significant implications for the manufacture of medical implants from PHB by laser machining.",
        "Drug-related illness is an everlasting universal problem and also an important cause of admissions to hospitals. Adverse reactions are still grossly underreported by medical professions. Little information is available regarding the frequency or type of ADRs managed in hospitals. Since January 1997, we have taken part in a study, supported by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Device to improve the spontaneous drug information reporting system in Germany. Three German regionalized Departments of Clinical Pharmacology--Jena, Dresden, Rostock--serve as Pharmacovigilance Centers in collaboration with the Pharmacoepidemiology Research Group of the University of Munich. Since January 1997, the regional group in Jena has been monitoring the University Clinic of Internal Medicine for admissions caused by adverse drug reactions. All emergency cases and patients on intensive care units were checked for adverse drug reactions. We present our results, including clinical and demographic data, concerning intoxications and especially those involving digitoxin in 210 patients with ADR. Forty patients with digitoxin toxicity had an average age of 81 years (81.1+/-6.3), a low body weight (59.7+/-12.7 kg) and 3 out of 4 were women. 75% of all patients with digitoxin side effects had elevated serum digitoxin levels with concentrations higher than 25 microg/ml. The relatively high frequency of digitoxin intoxications in our hospital may reflect the advanced age and low body weight of patients. Patients received digitoxin regardless of age, weight and, sometimes, clinical indication. Physicians should be aware of drugs having a high risk when used in elderly patients. The use of digitoxin assays and keeping serum levels within or near the therapeutic range will diminish the incidence of overdoses.",

The relative weight of each APC is based on the median operating and capital cost of the services within the group based on hospital outpatient claims data for 1996. These data, however, do not accurately reflect the cost of innovative medical devices, drugs, and biologicals currently in use. To account for these developments, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) established the transitional pass-through payment system to provide additional amounts above the applicable APC rate for innovative medical devices, drugs, and biologicals. The BBRA also established a cost-outlier adjustment. Successfully calculating payments for pass-through and outlier devices requires that financial managers have a thorough knowledge of the medical devices, drugs, and biologicals being used in their outpatient surgery departments.",
        "Epizoonoses such as scabies, lice and cimicosis are common, vexing disorders that occur worldwide. Historically, many treatment modalities have been employed in the management of these disorders, and most of the drugs described in this review are of historical interest and no longer recommended or in widespread use because of their wide spectrum of adverse effects. More recently, reports documenting resistance against various antiectoparasite drugs, complicated and severe courses of the diseases, and adverse effects of drug therapy have prompted the development of new treatment strategies and drugs for optimal disease management. Because the strategies currently recommended for the treatment of ectoparasites differ worldwide, this review proposes a rational approach to selecting the best therapeutic agent by comparing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, drug efficacy and adverse effects. A literature search of the currently Internet accessible libraries PubMed, Medline and Ideal library, of citations of articles found there, and from communications with the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, Germany, was conducted based on this approach. One major observation of this literature search is that permethrin is the treatment of choice for lice and scabies in the US and in Great Britain, whereas lindane is still recommended for scabies in most other European countries because of its longer-standing record of effectiveness. Although permethrin has not yet been proven to be more effective than lindane in treating infections with these ectoparasites, it currently appears to have the best efficacy versus safety profile of topical treatments for scabies and lice. Ivermectin is a newer oral drug for the treatment of ectoparasites, which has been used with great success in the treatment of onchocercosis and other endoparasites. Although ivermectin appears to be a promising drug, its role in the treatment of ectoparasitic infections will be clarified as more study data become available. Finally, it is important to emphasise the clinical aspects of ectoparasite therapy and that providing the patient with optimal instructions on the use of topical therapeutics is of great importance in avoiding adverse effects and assuring complete removal of the ectoparasite, thereby avoiding the development of drug-resistance.",
        "Bacteria that adhere to implanted medical devices or damaged tissue can encase themselves in a hydrated matrix of polysaccharide and protein, and form a slimy layer known as a biofilm. Antibiotic resistance of bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth contributes to the chronicity of infections such as those associated with implanted medical devices. The mechanisms of resistance in biofilms are different from the now familiar plasmids, transposons, and mutations that confer innate resistance to individual bacterial cells. In biofilms, resistance seems to depend on multicellular strategies. We summarise the features of biofilm infections, review emerging mechanisms of resistance, and discuss potential therapies.",

        "A prototype computerized system for automatic data collection from multi-vendor infusion devices was constructed. The system was specifically designed around the needs of the critical care environment, and a survey of clinical staff was conducted to determine the functional requirements. Hardware, software and system configuration was based on the Medical Information Bus IEEE 1073 standard for medical device data communications. The infusion devices were configured into device communication controllers (DCC), which were polled at 0.25 Hz by a PC configured as a bedside communication controller (BCC). The system stores data samples after intervals of 1 ml of drug delivery and following any changes in the infusion rate. The system demonstrated significant opportunities for supporting clinical care and for the management of health care technology.",
        "Recently the Medical Devices Agency recommended that 'ophthalmic devices that touch the surface of the eye should be restricted to single use'.\nTo evaluate one such device: a disposable tonometer prism for routine applanation tonometry.\nThe intraocular pressure (IOP) of 100 consecutive patients from a general eye clinic (197 eyes) was measured with both a disposable and the standard Goldmann tonometer (Goldmann). The level of agreement between the two methods of clinical measurement was assessed and the sensitivity and specificity of the disposable prism in detecting clinically significant raised IOP estimated.\nThe mean difference in IOP measured by the two different prisms was 0.44 mmHg with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.54. The mean IOP for the disposable prism was 19.51 mmHg (SD 6.53 mmHg). The mean IOP for the standard Goldmann tonometer prism was 19.07 mmHg (SD 6.64 mmHg). The sensitivity to detect IOP > 21 mmHg was 95.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 86.0-99.5%) and the specificity of 93.9% (95% CI: 88.8-97.2%). It gave a positive predictive value of 83.9% (95% CI: 71.7-92.4%).\nThere was close agreement between the IOP measurements obtained by the disposable tonometer prism and the Goldmann device for high and low pressures. If replicated, the high sensitivity and specificity would justify its use in screening.",
        "The potential role of therapeutic ultrasound in medicine is promising. Currently, medical devices are being developed that utilize high-intensity focused ultrasound as a noninvasive method to treat tumors and to stop bleeding (hemostasis). The primary advantage of ultrasound that lends the technique so readily to use in noninvasive therapy is its ability to penetrate deep into the body and deliver to a specific site thermal or mechanical energy with submillimeter accuracy. Realizing the full potential of acoustic therapy, however, requires precise targeting and monitoring. Fortunately, several imaging modalities can be utilized for this purpose, thus leading to the concept of image-guided acoustic therapy. This article presents a review of high-intensity focused ultrasound therapy, including its mechanisms of action, the imaging modalities used for guidance and monitoring, some current applications, and the requirements and technology associated with this exciting and promising field.",

        "The coagulase-negative staphylococci and, in particular, Staphylococcus epidermidis, have emerged as major nosocomial pathogens associated with infections of implanted medical devices. These organisms, which are among the most prevalent bacteria of the human skin and mucous membrane microflora, present unique problems in the diagnosis and treatment of infections involving biofilm formation on implanted biomaterials. Epidemiological data that address whether invasive S. epidermidis strains can be traced to commensal organisms or an endemic occurrence of distinct strains with enhanced virulence have important implications for the implementation of appropriate infection control measures. An extracellular polysaccharide adhesin represents a key virulence determinant in S. epidermidis and is required for biofilm formation. Production of this adhesin, which is encoded by the ica operon, is subject to phase variable regulation (ON <---> OFF switching). Recent advances in understanding the molecular events controlling polysaccharide adhesin synthesis and the potential clinical implications of its phase variable regulation are outlined. Further research in this area may contribute to the development of novel strategies for therapeutic intervention. Finally, in addition to antibiotic prophylaxis, preventive strategies to control S. epidermidis medical device-related infections are focusing on the development of improved biomaterials and physical electrical barriers to impede bacterial colonisation.",
        "The mycobactericidal activity of various dialdehydes has been assessed by a quantitative suspension test in both 'clean' and 'dirty' conditions. Test organisms consisted of glutaraldehyde (GTA)-sensitive strains of Mycobacterium chelonae NCTC 946, M. abscessus NCTC 10882, two GTA-resistant M. chelonae strains and M. terrae NCTC 10856 (a proposed M. tuberculosis surrogate). The aldehydes tested were a new high-level disinfectant, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) at 0.5% (v/v) unadjusted pH 6.5 and pH 8, GTA at 0.5% (v/v) pH 8, glyoxal at 0.5% (v/v) pH 8 and 10% (v/v) unadjusted pH 2.8, malonaldehyde sodium salt (NaMDA) at 0.5% (w/v) pH 8 and 10% (w/v) unadjusted pH 7.5 and succinaldehyde at 0.5% (v/v) pH 8. Results showed that 0.5% acidic and alkaline OPA were rapidly mycobactericidal, under both 'clean' and 'dirty' conditions, and more importantly were active against GTA-resistant strains. The washer disinfector isolates of M. chelonae were, as expected, extremely resistant to 0.5% GTA which was slowly mycobactericidal against the other strains. Glyoxal, NaMDA and succinaldehyde were ineffective against all the strains investigated. However, a high concentration of glyoxal exhibited a slow mycobactericidal activity except with M. terrae NCTC 10856, but this was not observed with NaMDA. This evaluation, using a quantitative suspension test based on a European standard, supported the claim that OPA is an effective choice as a high-level disinfectant for medical devices.",
        "Manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices and laboratory management have become integral partners in building and improving the quality of laboratory services. There is an increasing awareness that quality is inherent in the design of any reagent or analytical system. In vitro diagnostic medical devices should provide patients, users and third parties with a high level of health protection. Therefore, both manufacturers and users must work in partnership for continual improvement. For manufacturers, standards such as ISO 9000 already exist to guide applications of quality practices. In the field of laboratory medicine, the availability of a specific, universal standard (ISO/DIS 15189) for quality management in medical laboratories will represent a great opportunity for harmonising medical laboratories at an international level. In addition, accreditation of medical laboratories according to the proposed ISO 15189 standard can help develop the relationships between laboratories, and the biological follow-up of travelling patients. Manufacturers are able to help laboratory management to reach a high level of quality, not only by providing high value products, but also on the basis of their own experience of ISO 9000 certification.",
        "Inadequate cleaning and disinfection of medical devices, including flexible endoscopes, can result in the transmission of micro-organisms to patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the design of medical devices on the efficacy of manual cleaning of endoscope channels.\nThe investigation was carried out using four endoscopes (two duodenoscopes and two gastroscopes). The air/water channels of one duodenoscope and one gastroscope were freely accessible and could be brushed. The instrumentation and the air/water channels were contaminated with blood containing Enterococcus faecium as a test organism. After manual cleaning of the channels by flushing and, where possible, brushing, the recovery rates for the test organism were studied.\nThe comparable rates for recovery of the test organism after cleaning of the instrumentation channels proved that the method used was reproducible. With regard to the air/water channels, the rate of micro-organisms in the cleaning solution recovered after flushing alone was a maximum of 3 % relative to the rate detected after brushing and flushing.\nThe data collected in the study show that only flushing channels that are not freely accessible resulted in significantly lower (P<0.001) recovery rates for the test organism. In practice, this means that contamination may remain in the channels, and it shows that the design of a medical device has an important influence on the reprocessing of reusable instruments such as flexible endoscopes.",

        "A novel surface modification method has been developed to improve biocompatibility of polymeric biomaterials. This approach involves ozonation and then followed by graft polymerization with acrylates containing PEG, sulfonated PEG or by coupling of PEG derivatives. All the reactions were confirmed by ATR FT-IR and ESCA. The degree of ozonation measured by the iodide method was dependent on the ozone permeability of the polymers used. Surface hydrophilicity was investigated by measuring the contact angles. Ozonation itself yielded a slight increase in hydrophilicity and a decrease in platelet adhesion, but PEG immobilization showed a significant effect on surface hydrophilicity and platelet adhesion to confirm well-known PEG's passivity which minimize the adhesion of blood components on polymer surfaces. Both graft polymerization and coupling were effective for PU. In contrast, only grafting gave enough yields for PMMA and silicone. Platelet adhesion results demonstrated that all PEG modified surfaces adsorbed lower platelet adhesion than untreated or ozonated ones. Polymers coupled with sulfonated PEG exhibited the lowest platelet adhesion when compared with control and PEG coupled ones by virtue of the synergistic effect of non-adhesive PEG and negatively charged SO3 groups. This PEG or sulfonated PEG immobilization technology using ozonation is relatively simple for introducing uniform surface modification and therefore very useful for practical application of blood contacting medical devices.",

However, with the recent increase in infants presenting with this condition, numerous orthotic treatment programs have been established throughout the country. Until recently, federal regulation of this \"industry\" was largely ignored.\nIn 1995 our office was served notice that our orthosis would require clearance from the FDA. Since the FDA had never approved a medical device of this kind, clearance presented a significant challenge. However, after 3 years of providing clinical data, clearance was finally granted, and a new device category known generically as \"cranial orthosis\" was created. A cranial orthosis is considered to be a Class II neurology device and requires both general and special controls in order to ensure its safety and effectiveness.\nOrthotics used for the treatment of deformational plagiocephaly are regulated by the FDA and are considered Class II neurology devices. Submission of a premarket notification (510[k]) is required prior to placing these devices on the market.",
        "In the following eleven lessons learned from the silicone breast implant saga in the United States are listed. Some Lessons From The Saga Of Silicone Breast Implants In The U.S. 1. The intrinsic differences between science and the law mean that there will continue to be tension at the interface between the two. 2. Weak scientific evidence makes for weak scientific, clinical and legal judgments. 3. Health policy can influence the weighing of evidence as did the FDA ban on gel filled silicone breast implants in 1992. 4. As the probative value of scientific evidence decreases (that is, the quality and relevance of the evidence) the courts have increasing difficulty in evaluation. 5. Weak scientific evidence along with poor legal judgments can distort clinical understanding and result in harm to patients. 6. Widely publicized speculation and litigation can obscure less dramatic but frequent and serious complications. 7. Clinicans, toxicologists, industry and regulators should maintain surveillance of medical devices, in representative groups if not in all recipients of the devices. 8. The precise identity and composition of each medical device implanted into a person should be recorded both by the manufacturer and in the health care record. 9. The factual basis for informed consent should be vetted by a disinterested party. 10. Patients, clinicians and industry all have a strong interest in assuring the safety of medical devices through regulation. 11. The criteria and process for evaluating the admissibility of scientific evidence in legal proceedings have been improved but universal adoption of the improvements has not been accomplished and further changes may be necessary.",
        "Disposable trocars with safety shields are widely used for laparoscopic access. The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors associated with injuries resulting from their use as reported to the Food and Drug Administration.\nManufacturers are required to report medical device-related incidents to the Food and Drug Administration. We analyzed the 629 trocar injuries reported from 1993 through 1996.\nThere were three types of injury: 408 injuries of major blood vessels, 182 other visceral injuries (mainly bowel injuries), and 30 abdominal wall hematomas. Of the 32 deaths, 26 (81%) resulted from vascular injuries and 6 (19%) resulted from bowel injuries. Eighty-seven percent of deaths from vascular injuries involved the use of disposable trocars with safety shields and 9% involved disposable trocars with a direct-viewing feature. The aorta (23%) and inferior vena cava (15%) were the vessels most commonly traumatized in the fatal vascular injuries. Ninety-one percent of bowel injuries involved trocars with safety shields and 7% involved direct-view trocars. The diagnosis of an enterotomy was delayed in 10% of cases, and the mortality rate in this group was 21%. In 41 cases (10%) the surgeon initially thought the trocar had malfunctioned, but in only 1 instance was malfunction subsequently found when the device was examined. The likelihood of injury was not related to any specific procedure or manufacturer.\nThese data show that safety shields and direct-view trocars cannot prevent serious injuries. Retroperitoneal vascular injuries should be largely avoidable by following safe techniques. Bowel injuries often went unrecognized, in which case they were highly lethal. Device malfunction was rarely a cause of trocar injuries.",

        "Many medical equipment items need periodic attention to ensure that they continue to operate properly and safely; and most inspecting agencies require healthcare facilities to have a competent equipment maintenance program that is focused on the most critical of those devices. There is however a long-standing lack of consensus on how best to determine which devices should be included in this critical device category, and which can reasonably be excluded. A new methodology is proposed for establishing a logical, fact-based framework for determining which devices should be included. It is based in part on a new FDA-sanctioned definition of what an appropriate regimen of planned maintenance activities for a medical device should include. This new definition addresses the medical device users' concerns about periodic performance verification and safety testing as well as detecting and correcting the wear or progressive deterioration of any non-durable parts, which is the primary focus of the conventional preventive maintenance programs found in less critical industries. The analytical approach proposed utilizes technical information that is either already available or which can be easily developed. It characterizes each different device by means of a 3-letter maintenance sensitivity profile that can be used to analyze the effectiveness of the maintenance procedures as well as quantify the device's sensitivity to planned maintenance. A collaborative effort to assemble and organize this data would provide the industry with a sound, logical platform for narrowing the scope of most PM programs and allow us to redirect a significant amount of scarce technical manpower into more productive activities such as device user training.",
        "The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the cleaning and bacterial killing ability of a new non-enzyme-based formulation (killing detergent solution [KDS]) compared with commercially available enzymatic detergents that included Metrizyme (Metrex Research Division of Sybron Canada Ltd. Morrisburg, Ontario) and Gzyme (Germiphene Corp, Brantford, Ontario). KDS is a hydrogen peroxide-based detergent formulation that combines cleaning efficacy with the ability to kill microorganisms. The KDS formulation helps ensure the protection of the health care worker from infectious risk during the soaking and cleaning stages of medical device reprocessing and reduces the bioburden on devices before sterilization/disinfection.\nTest organisms that included Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella choleraesuis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were suspended in artificial test soil (ATS-B; patent submitted), inoculated at 10(6) colonyforming units per carrier and dried overnight before detergent exposure. The ATS-B mimics the blood, protein, carbohydrate, and endotoxin levels of patient-used medical devices. Plastic lumen carriers and a flexible colonoscope were used for surface and simulated-use testing, respectively.\nThe results for the microbial challenge dried onto polyvinyl chloride (PVC) carriers demonstrated that the ability of KDS to remove protein, blood, carbohydrate, and endotoxin from surface test carriers was as effective as the enzyme detergents that were evaluated. Furthermore, KDS was able to effect approximately a 5-Log(10) reduction in microbial loads with a 3-minute exposure at room temperature, whereas none of the other detergents were as effective. In simulated-use testing of a soiled colonoscope, KDS was significantly better at ensuring microbial killing compared with Gzyme and Metrizyme and was equivalent to the enzymatic detergents in cleaning ability.\nIn summary the KDS has excellent microbial-killing ability in 3-minute exposures at room temperature and cleans as well as the existing enzymatic detergent formulations that were tested.",
        "Although polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) is thought to be crucial in the pathogenesis of prosthetic device infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, its role in prosthetic device infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus is unknown. To assess the clinical impact of PIA production, isolates from 15 prospectively identified cases of S. aureus bacteremia in patients with prosthetic joints (8 infected, 7 uninfected) were characterized for biofilm production, hemagglutination, and the presence of a 419-bp amplification product within icaA. Although icaA was present in all 15 isolates, none of the isolates produced hemagglutination and only one isolate (from a patient with an uninfected prosthetic device) weakly produced biofilm in vitro. These results support the observation that the ica locus is conserved between S. epidermidis and S. aureus and that PIA may be expressed only under in vivo conditions. Future investigations should include animal models to approximate the complex milieu surrounding implanted prosthetic medical devices.",

        "Tissue generation by autogenous cell transplantation is one of the most promising treatment concepts being developed as it eliminates problems of donor site scarcity, immune rejection and pathogen transfer. Cultured cells are seeded onto a three-dimensional biocompatible scaffold that will slowly degrade and resorb as the soft and hard structures grow and assimilate in vitro and/or in vivo. The 3-D scaffold provides the necessary template for cells to proliferate and maintain their differentiated state. Ultimately, it defines the overall shape of the tissue-engineered transplant. The aim of this review is to describe and discuss the scaffold materials of natural and synthetic origin that are of specific interest to tissue engineers. This review is based on previous publications and our own experience in the use of biomaterials of natural and synthetic origin for tissue engineering applications. Biodegradable polymers which have been used for tissue engineering applications are mainly based on clinically established medical devices and implants. In the group of macromolecules of natural origin collagen, alginate, agarose, hyaluronic acid derivatives, chitosan, and fibrin glue have been used as scaffolds. Man-made polymers such as polyglycolide (PGA), polylactides (PLLA, PDLA), poly(caprolactone) (PCL), and poly(dioxanone) (PDS) have been studied as matrix material to guide the differentiation and proliferation of cells into the targeted functional premature and/or mature tissue. Appropriate selection of scaffold material with respect to the targeted tissue is essential. Today, biomaterials of choice remain to be those approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In spite of that, novel biomaterials should be developed specifically designed for tissue engineering applications.",
        "Both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are important causes of infections associated with catheters and other medical devices. It has recently been shown that not only S. epidermidis but also S. aureus can produce slime and carries the ica operon responsible for slime production. In the operon, coexpression of icaA and icaD is required for full slime synthesis. In this study, the presence of icaA and icaD was determined in a collection of 91 staphylococcal (68 S. epidermidis and 23 S. aureus) strains from intravenous catheter-associated infections, in 10 strains from the skin and mucosa of healthy volunteers, and in two reference strains by a PCR method. Slime-forming ability was tested on Congo red agar plates; 49% of S. epidermidis strains from catheters and, surprisingly, 61% of S. aureus strains were icaA and icaD positive and slime forming. All the saprophytic strains turned out to be negative for both icaA and icaD and also non-slime forming. Two S. aureus and one S. epidermidis strain from catheters, detected as icaA and icaD positive by PCR analysis and as slime forming (black colonies) at 24 h on Congo red agar, at 48 h exhibited tiny red spikes at the center of black colonies. The onset of these variants could not be ascribed to a mutagenic potential of Congo red, which, in the Ames test, was devoid of mutagenicity. PCR analysis showed that these red variants were negative for both icaA and icaD and even lacking the entire icaADBC operon. The data reported indicate an important role of ica genes as a virulence marker in staphylococcal infections from intravenous catheters.",

Second, to assess the diagnostic efficacy of the CXRs.\nOne-hundred-seventy-four CXRs acquired in 74 patients, either routinely or after invasive procedures, were analysed. The indication of the obtained CXRs, or the absence of indication in patients in whom no CXRs was taken, was compared with ACR guidelines. The position of medical devices was evaluated. Changes in cardiopulmonary status were noted.\nSixty-seven percent of the CXRs were in accordance with the ACR guidelines, and in 74% of patients in whom no CXRs were taken this was also in accordance with these guidelines. Sixteen percent of the endotracheal tubes, 23% of central venous lines and 15% of nasogastric tubes were malpositioned. Changes in cardiopulmonary status, after the initial film, were noted in 63%.\nThe indications for the majority of CXRs in our PICU appeared to be in accordance with ACR guidelines. The high percentage of malpositioned tubes and lines and the number of cardiopulmonary changes on CXRs in a PICU underline the value of these films. Adjustments of the ACR guidelines for particular groups of paediatric patients may limit the number of CXRs taken and may further increase diagnostic efficacy.",
        "Point-of-care testing (POCT) can be introduced by laboratory directors or clinicians in response to the need for rapid results to guide treatment. The professional responsibility for ensuring reliable and accurate results is well-defined in some countries such as France, but the role and responsibility of the laboratory is less clear in many other places. When point-of-care instrument technology and the intrinsic design of the device leads to device-specific parameters or analytical differences from laboratory-based equipment, there is a risk of misinterpretation and erroneous treatment decisions. Laboratory staffs are more often aware of the interaction of analytical technology and result interpretation than clinicians, making it more rational to involve the laboratory in the selection of point-of-care equipment, procedures, and therapeutic decisions based on the results. The design control and risk-analysis provisions of emerging regulations such as the EU in vitro diagnostic medical device (IVD) can be interpreted as engaging the manufacturer's responsibility, even when the equipment is functioning according to specification. This is especially true of device-specific parameters in which cross-calibration or traceability to a reference material or method is not possible. This is a further argument for involvement of the laboratory in the selection and implementation of point-of-care testing devices.",

        "The laws under which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) operates have been changed by bipartisan Congressional efforts. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997, signed into law on November 21, 1997 modifies the mission of the FDA to include a goal of speeding research, innovation and access to care. The legislation allows fast track review for the most important drugs. It also allows drug companies to promote off label use of already-approved pharmaceuticals for other purposes. The controversial issue allows drug companies to provide physicians with documentation on the effectiveness of their drugs in treating other conditions. The industry supports the change since the revenue growth for off label use of drugs is especially important for smaller biotechnical companies, while consumer groups fear that it is a loophole for selling unproven drugs.

The new bills also lift the requirement for maintaining patient registries for those receiving high-risk medical devices. (Registries are helpful for contacting patients in case of product defects.) Finally, no monies raised through user fees will be used for FDA-sponsored research, thus eliminating the Antiviral Research Laboratory in the Division of Antiviral Research, a laboratory that helped to standardize viral load assays and develop new model systems for preclinical testing of therapeutic agents against HIV, HBV, HCV, and Mycobacterium avium. A partial victory for patient advocates was the House's requirement (not found in the Senate's version) that a sole manufacturer of a drug for a serious or life-threatening disease notifies the FDA six months before it plans to cease the drug's production.",
        "The Prosorba column has been studied as a novel therapy for rheumatoid arthritis in several clinical settings over the last 5 years. In this article, we summarize the pivotal clinical trial study supporting the safety and efficacy of the Prosorba column as it is applied to treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The Prosorba column is a medical device that contains purified staphylococcal protein A covalently bound to a silica matrix. This device is used to treat patient plasma in conjunction with a plasmapheresis machine. In this ex vivo treatment, blood is withdrawn from the patient, cells are separated from plasma in the machine, and the plasma is passed through the Prosorba column. The plasma then is recombined with the cells and returned to the patient. The Prosorba column was approved for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in 1987 and, in 2 open-label trials (1,2), showed promising evidence of efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis. A subsequent Phase 3 pivotal trial demonstrated statistical superiority of Prosorba treatments to sham column apheresis (3). Analysis of the pivotal trial of patients who completed all treatments indicated that 41.7% of the Prosorba treated patients met American College of Rheumatology defined response criteria as compared to 15.6% of the sham treated patients. This difference was significant at a level of p < or = 0.02.",
        "We present a case of a mechanical bowel obstruction secondary to an impacted vaginal pessary.

        "Latex mock arteries used in medical device testing allow researchers to evaluate mechanical characteristics of intravascular medical products without using animal or human clinical studies for this data. Such intravascular situations include determining properties such as drag and steerability of catheters, recoil of vascular stents, and clinician training. In fatigue testing, the latex mock arteries are used to receive deployed products and are then repeatedly pressurized at biologically relevant pressures to determine the long term durability of the product. By matching dimensions and pressure-volume relationships (compliance) of these latex tubes, researchers have a reliable means to evaluate and predict product lifetimes. The problem with latex mock arteries is two-fold: First, they are opaque so the product inside the artery cannot be seen during evaluation of the integrity of the product or during clinical training sessions. Second, latex tubes fatigue; therefore, the loading that they place on the internalized products varies with time. During long term durability studies, latex tubes may have to be replaced as often as every 100 million cycles. This can be problematic with products that are difficult to redeploy. We have developed a clear silicone mock artery system that allows us to fabricate three-dimensional objects, including tubes with precise geometric and mechanical properties. Our evaluations show that the mock arteries can be stressed up to 400 million cycles with little or no change in mechanical properties. We are in the process of continuing evaluations to determine long term durability.",
        "An important aspect of medical device development is the need to understand how a device produces a specific biological effect. The focus can then be on optimizing that effect by device modification and repeated testing. Several reports from this lab have targeted programmed cell death, or apoptosis, as a cellular pathway that is induced by exposure of transformed leukemic T-cells in culture to specific frequency and intensity electromagnetic fields (EMFs). An EMF delivery device capable of selectively inducing T-cell apoptosis in human tissues could be used to enhance healing by limiting the production of molecules that promote inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis and tendonitis. In the present study, we examined the normal T-cell response to EMF exposure in vitro. In the peripheral blood, 70-80% of the lymphocytes are T-cells, and thus is a rich source of normal cells that match the transformed T-cells used in other experiments (Jurkat cells). We isolated lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of humans and rats, cultured them in nutritive medium and exposed them to either a complex 1.8 mT pulsed EMF (Electrobiology, Inc.), a 0.1 mT, 60 Hz power frequency EMF or a 0.2 mT, 100 Hz sinusoidal EMF. Control lymphocytes were cultured similarly, without field exposure. Lymphocytes were then treated with T-cell mitogens and evaluated for proliferative capacity after an additional 72 hours culture. Results indicate that T-cell proliferation is modulated by in vitro exposure to defined EMFs. The potential use of an EMF delivery device capable of selectively inducing such T-cell effects is discussed.",
        "The risk of development of resistance in Staphylococcus epidermidis to the antibiotics and antiseptics impregnated in central venous catheters was evaluated. The culture was passaged 10-20 times through subinhibitory concentrations of different antimicrobials, singly and in combination, and the MIC of each antimicrobial before and after passage was compared. There was a 10- to 16-fold increase in the MIC of the combination of minocycline and rifampicin, while no significant increase in the MIC of minocycline alone was seen. The MIC of rifampicin was 25,000-fold higher against strains passaged through rifampicin alone (as compared with that for the original strain), while the increase was only 80-fold when it was combined with minocycline for passage. There was no substantial change in susceptibility to the antiseptic chlorhexidine when used alone or in combination with either silver sulphadiazine or triclosan (the MIC of triclosan alone increased eight-fold). In time-kill studies, synergy was observed between chlorhexidine and both triclosan and silver sulphadiazine. Zone of inhibition tests of catheters impregnated with minocycline and rifampicin showed that their activity against rifampicin-resistant strains was lower than that against the susceptible strain. On the other hand, the activity of the antiseptic (chlorhexidine and silver sulphadiazine) catheters against the rifampicin-resistant and -susceptible strains was similar. Although this study indicates that antibiotic catheters may be at a higher risk of being colonized by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the implications of these results in clinical settings need to be determined.",
        "ECVAM was established to play a leading role at the European level in the independent evaluation of the reliability and relevance of test methods and testing strategies for specific purposes through research on advanced methods and new test development and validation, so that chemicals and products of various kinds, including medicines, vaccines, medical devices, cosmetics, household products and agricultural products, can be manufactured, transported and used more economically and more safely, whilst the current relevance on animal test procedures is progressively reduced. Nowhere is this activity more necessary than in the field of immunotoxicology, where we know that chemicals and products of many kinds have the potential to stimulate, modulate or suppress the induction or expression of various types of immune responses. The problem is to effectively evaluate the potency of these effectors, and, since the available information is currently based on rather qualitative animal tests, to evaluate the true relevance of this knowledge and apply it intelligently in risk assessment processes which will protect human beings without unnecessarily limiting the development and use of materials which otherwise have economic, health and social benefits. The way forward must depend on the following: (a) a better understanding of immunotoxicological processes, based on a sounder understanding of the immune system itself (and of its network of control systems and interrelationships with other body systems); (b) The use of in vitro (not in vivo) systems based on human (not animal) cells and tissues; (c) integrated and tiered testing strategies, incorporating QSAR, as well as in vitro approaches; (d) taking advantage of the use of cells or factors from humans who have been exposed to potential immunotoxins, be this voluntarily, occupationally, environmentally or by accident; and (e) the recognition that virtually everything will effect one or more aspects of the immune system at some dose level and, in some circumstances, deciding when such effects are relevant, is the key to immunotoxicity testing. Some current ECVAM-sponsored work and activities at ECVAM are described.",
        "Estimates of epilepsy incidence among the U.S. population range between 0.5% and 1%. The most common type of seizure in adult patients is partial onset. Approximately 20% of these patients are refractory to antiepileptic drug therapy and experience intolerable side effects such as confusion, dizziness, weight gain, lethargy, and ataxia. The ketogenic diet appears to be beneficial for children but is not considered a standard option for adults. Epilepsy surgery can be an option for many and may offer control or a reduction in seizures. However, many patients are opposed to cranial surgery or may not tolerate the ketogenic diet. Recent advances in biomedical technology and perfection in surgical techniques have shown vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) using the Neuro Cybernetic Prosthesis (NCP) system is an effective new treatment option in reducing seizure frequency. On July 16, 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of the NCP for vagus nerve stimulation, as an adjunctive treatment for refractory partial onset seizures in adults and adolescents over 12 years of age. Murphy et al. and Wheless have reported similar results in children younger than 12 years. VNS represents the first therapy using a medical device approved by the FDA for the treatment of refractory seizures. An estimated 10,000 patients have been implanted with the device.",
        "In autumn 1993, AAMI/ST/WG 63, Sterilization Residuals Working Group undertook the task of studying factors involved in determining the amount of residual ethylene oxide in medical devices after sterilization and developing a protocol for controlling the relevant variables. The protocol was evaluated by conducting a round robin study consisting of 8 participating laboratories from around the country. Results of this round robin study demonstrated the range over which results may vary despite controls placed on the time and temperature at which determinations were conducted. The data from the study suggest that small, random variations in technique during short sample extraction times can lead to variability in the results. Variables such as initial water temperature, oven temperature, weighing of sample, and length of extraction should be carefully controlled. Inherent variations in the material composition of similar devices are possible contributing factors. The efforts of this working group and the subsequent evaluation and discussion of its findings are presented.",
        "A questionnaire was sent to 29 laboratory technicians regarding prescription writing by dentists for single anterior maxillary unit metal ceramic prostheses. Sixty nine per cent of the technicians responded and of these 40 per cent included copies of the typical prescriptions they receive. The results clearly showed that the standard of communication between dentist and laboratory technician is inadequate, although it has improved over recent years. The effectiveness of the Medical Devices Directive legislation was considered by reviewing the prescription sheets. It was concluded that many technicians still rely on contacting the prescribing dentist by telephone to clarify instructions and are often forced to make decisions without the necessary information. The finer details of prosthesis construction were found to be the weakest area of prescription writing. Time pressure was deemed the single greatest impediment to a harmonious working relationship. The recommendations of this paper are based on improving the levels of communication between these two members of the dental team. It is proposed that dentists should increase their awareness of the laboratory environment by maintaining closer links with their technicians. This would not only expand their understanding and appreciation of the laboratory environment, but also give the opportunity for discussing new developments in dental technology. Further undergraduate training in the area of laboratory prescription writing is also recommended.",
        "Biotechnology products for therapeutic use include a very diverse range of products, including growth factors, cytokines, hormones, receptors, enzymes, clotting factors, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, DNA vaccines, gene transfer products, cell therapies and tissue/organ grafts. While some of these products are regulated as medicinal products, the regulatory status of others such as some cell therapies and tissue/organ-based products differs globally and falls within the borderline between the practice of medicine, medical devices and medicinal products. The unclear regulatory status of some products can add to the complexity of the safety assessment of such products. Conventional non-clinical testing paradigms and guidelines for small molecule development are often not relevant for biotechnology products. Guidelines relating to the non-clinical safety evaluation of biotechnology products, gene transfer products and cell therapy products are available and represent a set of general guiding principals to be applied on a case-by-case basis. The quality, safety and efficacy of biotechnology products for therapeutic use are intricately linked, far more so than for conventional medicinal products, leading to the need for increased communication between those responsible for ensuring product quality and those responsible for non-clinical safety testing. Safety issues include microbiological safety (due to the use of biological materials either during the manufacturing process or as an integral part of the products), pharmacological/ biological toxicity (due to excessive primary pharmacology or undesirable secondary pharmacology), immunogenicity and potential tumourigenicity (for example, for growth factors, immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies and cell therapy products). Genotoxicity and intrinsic chemical toxicity are less of a problem for biotechnology products.",
        "Now that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has come out with its final policy on reusing single-use medical devices (SUDs), many hospitals are reviewing their options concerning reuse. Because FDA's policy imposes a whole new set of burdens on U.S. facilities that reprocess SUDs, a number of those hospitals will undoubtedly decide that they don't want to support an in-house reprocessing program anymore. Some hospitals will turn to third-party reprocessing companies to take on this burden for them. But choosing a reprocessor isn't as simple as looking up a name in the phone book. It's vital that a reprocessor be able to handle the devices that the hospital wants to reprocess (not all companies reprocess all devices). It's also vital that the company have policies and procedures in place that will allow it to provide dependable, high-quality service. And it's vital that the hospital be comfortable with the company or companies that it chooses. This article outlines the issues you need to examine when choosing a third-party reprocessing company. It also includes a checklist that you can use to judge each company under consideration.",

        "Prion diseases constitute a unique infection control problem because prions exhibit unusual resistance to conventional chemical and physical decontamination methods. Recommendations to prevent cross-transmission of infection from medical devices contaminated by Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have been based primarily on prion inactivation studies. The recommendations in this article consider inactivation data but also use epidemiological studies of prion transmission, infectivity of human tissues, and efficacy of removing microbes by cleaning. On the basis of the scientific data, only critical (e.g., surgical instruments) and semicritical devices contaminated with high-risk tissue (i.e., brain, spinal cord, and eye tissue) from high-risk patients--those with known or suspected infection with CJD--require special treatment.",
        "Indwelling medical devices are associated with infectious complications. Incorporating antimicrobials into indwelling materials may reduce bacterial colonization. Bismuth thiols are antibiofilm agents with up to 1,000-fold-greater antibacterial activity than other bismuth salts. Staphylococci are particularly sensitive, as determined by agar diffusion and broth dilution susceptibility testing. Bismuth-ethanedithiol inhibited 10 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains at 0.9 to 1.8, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 at 2.4, and S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 at 0.1 microM Bi(3+). Antiseptic-resistant S. aureus was sensitive to bismuth-2-3-dimercaptopropanol (BisBAL) at < or = 7 microM Bi(3+). Hydrogel-coated polyurethane rods soaked in BisBAL inhibited S. epidermidis for 39 days (inhibitory zone diameter in agar, > or = 30 mm for > 25 days). Slime from 16 slime-producing S. epidermidis strains was inhibited significantly by bismuth-3,4-dimercaptotoluene (BisTOL), but not by AgNO3, at subinhibitory concentrations. In conclusion, bismuth-thiols are bacteriostatic and bactericidal against staphylococci, including resistant organisms, but are also inhibitors of slime at subinhibitory concentrations. At subinhibitory concentrations, BisTOL may be useful in preventing the colonization and infection of indwelling intravascular lines, since staphylococci are important pathogens in this setting.",

        "The oral administration of ciprofloxacin (250mg bid) and ofloxacin (300mg bid) in 40 patients with ureteral stents, led to drug levels on all the device surfaces that were higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Escherichia coli (0.004--0.015 mg/l), the most common uropathogen. The drug levels in the film were higher than the MIC of other common pathogens, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.25--1.0 mg/l), Enterococcus faecalis (0.25--2.0 mg/l) and Staphylococcus aureus (0.12--0.5 mg/l) in a few cases (six, three and 14 cases out of 40, respectively). For both antibiotics, the concentrations were greater than the MIC of many uropathogens on the film surrounding the devices (0.89 vs 0.31 mg/l respectively, P=0.05), and on the devices themselves (0.22 vs. 0.12 mg/l, P=0.207). Adsorption of the antibiotics was higher to the film than to the stent (P<0.0001). Ciprofloxacin concentration on the film surrounding the stents was significantly higher than that of ofloxacin (P=0.05), while there was no statistical concentration difference between the two antibiotics adsorbed onto the actual devices (P=0.207). No bacteria were found in patients' urine and no biofilms were detected. This is the first report of an oral antibiotic being adsorbed onto medical devices. It potentially provides a new approach of preventing infection, and avoids the need to pre-coat devices with agents whose use will be restricted once bacteria develop resistance to them. If biomaterial properties can be enhanced to increase further the adsorptive concentration of drug, the risk of infections and recalcitrant biofilm formation could be significantly reduced in a highly susceptible patient population.",

In this state, microorganisms are highly resistant to antimicrobial treatment and are tenaciously bound to the surface.

        "Procedure-based surveys oflaparoscopic entry access injuries show a reassuringly low incidence, varying from 5 per 10,000 to 3 per 1,000, and, consequently, can provide only limited specific injury data. The current study uses existing injury-based reporting systems to access a uniquely large number of entry injuries to define the nature and outcomes of such events.\nClaims arising from US and non-US entry access injuries, between 1980 and 1999, reported to the Physicians Insurers Association of America by their member and affiliate companies and entry-injury medical device reports to the US FDA, from 1995 through October 1997, were analyzed to determine operative procedures, physician specialties, entry devices, and techniques associated with specific injuries. Individual injuries were analyzed for their relative incidence and potential to cause disability and death.\nFive hundred ninety-four structures or organs were injured in 506 patients, resulting in 65 deaths (13%). General surgical procedures made up at least 67% of combined medical device reports and US Physicians Insurers Association of America cases, and gynecologic procedures accounted for 63% of non-US claims. Bowel and retroperitoneal vascular injuries comprised 76% of all injuries incurred in the process of establishing a primary port. Nearly 50% of both small and large bowel injuries were unrecognized for 24 hours or longer. Delayed recognition, along with age greater than 59 years and major visceral vascular injuries, were each independent significant predictors of death.\nNo entry technique or device is absolutely safe. Avoidance of entry injuries depends on patient-specific anatomic orientation and control of entry axial force. Certain entry devices can be facilitating in controlling axial force. Overall, this large aggregate of entry access injuries shows them to be more serious and, along with other data, implies that they might be more common than reported in procedure-based studies.",
        "On the basis of carried laboratory tests of the aqueous extracts, such as pH evaluation, electric conductivity and dry residue assessment we can stated that the obtained results are within the limits of the standards and are comparable to these given for similar kinds of medical devices, e.g. for Dexon sutures: pH--6.10; electric conductivity--31 MicroScm-1; dry residue after evaporation--0.0014 g/100 cm3. The mean percentage of hemolysis counted from the three samples made for chitin extracts was 0.86% and did not exceed the value of 1% which is accepted by the standards. In the assessment of the cytotoxicity which was carried out on the mouse fibroblasts, the proper morphological character was stated. Agglutination, vacuolisation, nor cells membrane lysis were not observed. The number of cells separated from the matrix were identical as in the control cultures. The increased number of the dead cells and decreased proliferation of the cells in the cultures containing the chitin extracts, were probably due to the ethylene oxide residues, which was used for sterilisation of the fibres. The assessment of the intracutaneous reactivity of the chitin extracts showed the lack of the irritation influence and the index of primary irritation was of no importance at all. The pathomorphological findings, which included macroscopic and microscopic evaluation, specially carried out after the implantation, showed the greater biocompatibility of the tested chitin fibres in comparing them to the Maxon sutures. The healing process of these fibres included the short exudative phase, which was more significant than in Maxon sutures reaction followed by the proliferation phase, which ended with the development of the connective tissue capsule. The connective tissue penetrated among the single chitin fibres. After longer observation periods (more then 30 days) the thickness of the capsule decreased. The number of the chitin fibres did not change over the observations periods, however the change of the colour of the fibres was observed. In our opinion it is the sign that the process of resorption has already started. The tissue reactions after implantation of the chitin fibres can be compared to those observed for monofilament suture Maxon. On the basis of all these observations, assessments and findings we can stated that the chitin fibres fulfil the basic biological requirements set up for the bio-medical devices.",

        "Corrosion and wear of implanted medical devices may produce particulate debris, leading to acute and chronic inflammatory responses in the host. In the presence of biomaterial wear particles, host monocytes/macrophages are activated to synthesize or secrete mediators of inflammation. In order to understand the mechanisms underlying the host response to particulates and device-associated infections, we have focused on the effects of medical device particles on macrophage function, because these cells play a pivotal role in the body's response to foreign bodies and their interaction with other cellular components of the immune system. In order to evaluate the effects of particles of medical device materials on functional activities of macrophages, we developed a cyclooxygenase-II (COX-II) assay system using J774A.1 macrophages. Constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX-I) is present in cells under physiological conditions, whereas inducible COX-II is induced by some cytokines, mitogens, and endotoxin, presumably in pathological conditions such as inflammation. We have evaluated the inductive effects of implant materials, i.e., particles of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), hydroxyapatite (HA), titanium oxide, and silica, on the activity of COX-II using thin layer chromatography of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) formed from [1-(14)C]-labeled arachidonic acid (AA). Also, we have assessed the synergistic effects of these particles on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated macrophage activation. Addition of LPS to these particles increased PGD(2) production several-fold greater than the addition of any inducer alone. Our results indicated that device-associated infections could enhance inflammatory responses to the wear particles in subjects with medical implants or in whom particulate biomaterials are used for clinical purposes. The use of this model COX-II assay system may lead to the identification of inflammatory potentials for implant materials more specifically than present in vivo assays.",
        "Health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes evaluation is becoming an important component of clinical trials of new pharmaceuticals and medical devices. HRQL research provides patients, providers, and decision makers with important information on the impact of disease and treatment on physical, psychological, and social functioning and well-being. These outcomes are also useful to the pharmaceutical and device industries as they attempt to understand and communicate product value to physicians, patients, health insurers and others. HRQL labeling and promotional claims in the US are likely to increase over the next few years. The evidentiary requirements to make such a claim should be based on accepted scientific standards of HRQL evaluation and consistent with the regulatory requirements for clinical efficacy. This report outlines the scientific practices that should be considered in the evaluation of evidence for an HRQL claim, including the selection of appropriate domains, evidence to support the reliability and validity of HRQL measurement, considerations in research design and statistical analyses, and the issue of clinical significance. Representatives from the pharmaceutical and device industries, regulatory agencies, and the HRQL scientific community should work together to make certain the use of HRQL in labeling and promotion are based on sound scientific evidence, and that these messages are clearly and accurately reported to the consumers.",
        "To study the etiology and explore possibilities for the therapy of implant-associated infections, investigators have developed and utilized various in vitro models. Major contributions have come from the non-oral medical field, where device-related infections can create life-threatening situations. Microbiological models may include (i) models to study the reaction of micro-organisms to the presence of implants, (ii) models to study the reaction of implant-associated micro-organisms to antimicrobial agents, and (iii) models to study the reaction of the host tissues to the presence of implants contaminated with micro-organisms. In evaluating the potential usefulness of these models for research in oral implantology, one must consider common features as well as important differences between implanted medical devices and oral implants. Although infections associated with implantable medical devices and oral peri-implant infections share a remarkable number of common features, there are also important differences that need attention when findings from in vitro experiments are extrapolated to clinical relevance.",
        "Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common pathogen in medical device-associated infections. Its major pathogenetic factor is the ability to form adherent biofilms. The polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which is synthesized by the products of the icaADBC gene cluster, is essential for biofilm accumulation. In the present study, we characterized the gene locus inactivated by Tn917 insertions of two isogenic, icaADBC-independent, biofilm-negative mutants, M15 and M19, of the biofilm-producing bacterium S. epidermidis 1457. The insertion site was the same in both of the mutants and was located in the first gene, rsbU, of an operon highly homologous to the sigB operons of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. Supplementation of Trypticase soy broth with NaCl (TSB(NaCl)) or ethanol (TSB(EtOH)), both of which are known activators of sigB, led to increased biofilm formation and PIA synthesis by S. epidermidis 1457. Insertion of Tn917 into rsbU, a positive regulator of alternative sigma factor sigma(B), led to a biofilm-negative phenotype and almost undetectable PIA production. Interestingly, in TSB(EtOH), the mutants were enabled to form a biofilm again with phenotypes similar to those of the wild type. In TSB(NaCl), the mutants still displayed a biofilm-negative phenotype. No difference in primary attachment between the mutants and the wild type was observed. Similar phenotypic changes were observed after transfer of the Tn917 insertion of mutant M15 to the independent and biofilm-producing strain S. epidermidis 8400. In 11 clinical S. epidermidis strains, a restriction fragment length polymorphism of the sigB operon was detected which was independent of the presence of the icaADBC locus and a biofilm-positive phenotype. Obviously, different mechanisms are operative in the regulation of PIA expression in stationary phase and under stress induced by salt or ethanol.",
        "Medical devices, intended for blood contacting applications, undergo extensive in vitro testing followed by animal and clinical feasibility studies. Besides the use of materials known to be intrinsically blood-compatible, the surface of such devices is often modified with a coating in order to improve the performance characteristics during blood exposure. In vitro evaluation of blood-device interactions accompanies the product development cycle from the early design phase using basic material geometries until final finished-product testing. Specific test strategies can vary significantly depending on the end application, the particular study objectives and variables of interest, and cost. To examine the degree to which findings derived from two different in vitro approaches complement one another, this report contrasts findings from a simple multipass loop model with findings from a simulated cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) model. The loop model consists of tubular test materials, with and without surface modification, formed into valved Chandler loops. The CPB model has an oxygenator with and without surface modification connected to a reservoir and a blood pump. The surface modifications studied in this report are the Carmeda BioActive Surface and Duraflo II heparin coatings. Common blood parameters in the categories of coagulation, platelets, hematology, and immunology were monitored in each model. Ideal models employ the optimal level of complexity to study the design variables of interest and to meet practical cost considerations. In the case of medical device design studies, such models should also be predictive of performance. In the more complex and realistic simulated CPB model, experimental design and cost factors prevented easy/optimum manipulation of critical variables such as blood donor (use of paired samples) and heparin level. Testing in the simpler loop model, on the other hand, readily offered manipulation of these variables, and produced findings which overlapped with observations from the more complex CPB model. Thus, the models described here complimented one another. Moreover, conclusions from consistent findings, such as favorable responses associated with the heparin coatings, between the two models were considered to be more robust.",
        "X-ray radiographic examination of the bone fracture healing process is a widely used method in the treatment and management of patients. Medical devices made of metallic alloys reportedly produce considerable artifacts that make the interpretation of radiographs difficult. Fiber reinforced polymer composite materials have been proposed to replace metallic alloys in certain medical devices because of their radiolucency, light weight, and tailorable mechanical properties. The primary objective of this paper is to provide a comparable radiographic analysis of different fiber reinforced polymer composites that are considered suitable for biomedical applications. Composite materials investigated consist of glass, aramid (Kevlar-29), and carbon reinforcement fibers, and epoxy and polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) matrices. The total mass attenuation coefficient of each material was measured using clinical X-rays (50 kev). The carbon fiber reinforced composites were found to be more radiolucent than the glass and kevlar fiber reinforced composites.",

        "With the first clinical use of the artificial kidney over 5 decades ago, we entered into a new era of medicine-that of substitutive and replacement therapy. Yet it took nearly another 15 years until chronic treatment was possible and nearly another 15 years until widespread treatment was possible due to government support. The history of development and clinical use of other artificial organ technologies such as the artificial heart and heart valves, the artificial lung, artificial blood, joint replacements, the artificial liver, the artificial pancreas, immunologic, metabolic, and neurologic support, neurocontrol, and tissue substitutes have followed similar long development paths. Despite their relatively long time to be put into clinical use, the contributions of artificial organ technologies to the betterment of mankind have been unquestionably a major success. For example, modern day surgery would not be possible without heart-lung support, and the technologies for heart support have led to the development of various minimally invasive technologies. The powerful impact that artificial organ technologies presently has on our lives is seen through the statistic that in the U.S.A. nearly 1 in 10 persons is living with an implanted medical device. With the aging of our population and the improvements in technologies, these numbers will only increase.",

        "Trilucent (\"Soya Bean\") breast implants were marketed as a safe alternative to silicon implants. Following their use in the UK for the past four years, a reassessment of this has currently been announced (March 1999) and further implantation has been suspended by the Trilucent company in conjunction with the MDA (Medical Devices Agency). This has been the result of some reports of adverse reactions to the triglyceride filling material when the implant ruptures. All patients with trilucent implants were advised to return to their respective surgeons for review and advice. A personal review has been undertaken by the author of this paper. The results obtained are discussed. The majority of patients were concerned, but were happy with cosmetic results, and did not at present wish their implants removed. None appeared as yet to have had serious complications that could be attributed to the implants.",

        "Patient care in Intensive Care Units and Operating Rooms requires sophisticated instrumentation for monitoring, treatment and control. A major technical problem is the communication between devices, since the connection of medical devices from different manufacturers has similar problems to the communication between people from different countries who do not share a common language. Several proprietary solutions have been developed by initiatives from well-known international companies. These proprietary, non-open solutions have not gained general acceptability and have failed to draw upon the immense resources for instrumentation development which are available in the industry. Consequently, a set of open European standards for Medical Device Intercommunication has recently been created (ratified 1999) to provide the ability to connect devices to each other freely and to exchange data between them. The development of such standards has lead to the design and implementation of a network platform over which those standards could be tested and validated. At the same time guidelines have been defined for the development and deployment of open solutions for any kind of medical device, including existing legacy devices. The design and testing of this open standards implementation is described in this paper.",

        "The use of Trilucent breast implants in the UK dates back to 1995 and their introduction coincided with the medium-term effects of the silicone-implant controversy. We present a review of 3 years' experience of the Trilucent implant (1996-1998) during which 29 patients with a mean age of 39.4 years had a total of 50 implants. The aim of the study was to analyse the results in these patients in terms of complications, reoperation rate and patient satisfaction. Using a combination of retrospective chart analysis and postal survey, we found an incidence of implant deflation of 10% (5/50). The overall reoperation rate was 20% (10/50). The postal survey yielded a mean satisfaction score of 7.1 (on a scale of 0-10) from the 20 respondents out of the 29 patients (68.9%). In view of the high complication rate, we discontinued the use of Trilucent implants in advance of their withdrawal by the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) in March 1999. However, these findings may now be considered of added interest, particularly with regard to patients who are opting to keep their Trilucent implants despite the recommendation of the MDA in June 2000 that such implants should be removed.",
        "Cross-inhibition by quorum-sensing pheromones between Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated using all known S. aureus agr pheromone subgroups. All S. aureus subgroups were sensitive towards the S. epidermidis pheromone, with the exception of the recently identified subgroup 4. The subgroup 4 pheromone was also the only S. aureus pheromone able to inhibit the S. epidermidis agr response. The close relation of subgroup 4 to subgroup 1 suggests that subgroup 4 might have evolved from subgroup 1 by mutation under the selective pressure of competition with S. epidermidis. The competition between S. aureus and S. epidermidis by means of quorum-sensing cross talk seems to be generally in favor of S. epidermidis, which might explain the predominance of S. epidermidis on the skin and in infections on indwelling medical devices.",
        "Animal tests which have to be performed according to national (DIN) and international standards (EN and ISO) are evaluated according to the 3Rs principle of Russel and Burch in order to reduce suffering and numbers of test animals and also to completely replace them by non-animal methods. When on January 1, 1995, the EU Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC was accepted by all EU member states, animal tests that were essential parts of DIN, EN and ISO standards got a new legal status since for biocompatibility testing EU Directive 93/42/EEC is refering to these standards. In the present study all DIN standards were collected, in which animal testing is required, and they were then evaluated from the view points of both scientific state of the art and of consumer protection to decide if these animal tests can be replaced by non-animal methods. Our search of the literature revealed not only that to each of the animal tests promising alternatives have been proposed but also that only a few of them have sufficiently been validated to date. Moreover, we found that several of the animal tests described in DIN standards are not any more representing the current state of the art in the biomedical sciences. Therefore, these animal tests should immediately be deleted from the standards. Thus we are proposing to the DIN institue, the national agency for standards in Germany, immediate action which is required to update each of these DIN standards according to EU Directive 86/609/EEC for the protection of experimental animals. Our proposals are recommending to completely delete some of the animal tests from the standards, or to replace them by validated alternatives or to conduct formal validation studies with the most promising alternatives.",
        "The ever-increasing complexity of medical device therapy and installation of public electronic security systems demands vigilance in discerning interactions that may be harmful to patients during typical activities of daily living. Premature pacemaker stimulation, isolated skipped beats, or reversion to backup asynchronous pacing have been observed during in vitro and in vivo testing. To date, no deaths and only minor inconvenience have been reported during extreme exposure of patients with pacemakers when they have come directly in contact with or in close apposition to electronic security systems. Patients with any type of implanted electronic medical system should be forewarned: \"Don't lean, don't linger\" near any potential source of electromagnetic interference. Changing technologies in implantable electronic medical systems as well as societal sources of electromagnetic interference require continued awareness on the part of physicians and patients alike, with care being taken to distinguish largely theoretical hazards from those that constitute meaningful dangers to patients with implanted cardiac arrhythmia devices.",
        "Over 15 months, 60 patients at a German University Hospital became infected or colonized by a multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, which was isolated from tracheal secretions, blood, urine, venous catheters, ascites and several wounds. Most patients had undergone invasive treatment (surgery, cancer therapy). The genetic relationship of the isolates was investigated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The isolates were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems and aztreonam, to aminoglycosides and quinolones. The only in vitro susceptibility was to polymyxin B. Extensive sampling was carried out to identify contaminated medical devices, surfaces or media (water, food). Samples were taken from doctors and nursing staff and various treatment procedures were observed for several weeks. The handling of respirators, resuscitation tubes, urine bottles, and bedpans resulted in the contamination of the patients' environment, although most devices were cleaned and disinfected with automatic washer/disinfectors. Several wash basins on the intensive care unit were contaminated, but none of the drinking water samples showed any growth of P. aeruginosa. We recommend the strict use of gloves and strict application of alcoholic hand disinfectants immediately after discarding the gloves. The chain of infection ceased after strict cohort isolation and the subsequent introduction of the specific hygiene regime.",
        "In 1999, a Blue Ribbon Panel convened to examine the health effects of two commonly used plasticizers present in medical devices and toys. Of particular interest were the plasticizers used in medical tubing. Hospitalized patients can be exposed to a high dose of these chemicals while receiving respiratory therapy or during hemodialysis, and are more likely to be vulnerable to potentially ill effects than healthy individuals. After extensive review of existing research, the Panel concluded that there was not enough evidence of harmful health effects to remove di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and other plasticizers from use in medical tubing. The Panel recognized the importance of plasticizers in enabling tubing such as PVC for respiratory support or in dialysis to be flexible enough for use in a variety of clinical applications that might not be possible with rigid (plasticizer-free) tubing. Nevertheless, we reviewed the literature regarding the health effects for five of the most common compounds, plasticizers and antioxidants found in medical tubing, and suggest that further clinical studies be conducted. We concur with the Panel's recommendation that alternative materials be developed and studied.",
        "Today's radiology community depends heavily on cutting-edge diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices to serve patients. These products are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a system that grants marketing approval for only those indications for which the safety and effectiveness have been established. Although this complex system is the result of a societal decision to ensure device safety and effectiveness, it has the potential to delay product marketing and impede innovation. Medical device regulation recently has undergone major changes with the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA), legislation that is intended to increase system efficiency while retaining the requirement of safety and effectiveness. However, many of the envisioned improvements cannot occur without cooperative interaction between stakeholders in the device development process, including the FDA and the clinical medicine community. The radiology field must continue to build on its strong history of productive dialogue with the FDA to transform the legislative vision of FDAMA into regulatory reality. Such action will ensure timely access to the new device technologies that are necessary for the growth of our specialty and the effective care of our patients.",
        "We evaluated radiofrequency (RF) transmission to various monitoring devices using circuits that simulated potentially hazardous conditions for patients in the operating room. Right heart ejection fraction (REF) pulmonary artery catheters, transesophageal atrial pacing stethoscopes, and temperature-sensing esophageal stethoscopes were subjected to RF transmission from an electrosurgery unit. Peak voltage and spark intensity were measured in circuits between the electrocautery dispersive pad and conductive elements of the various medical devices. All monitoring devices with an exposed conductive surface were found to have induced voltages and even spark generation. The ranking for peak voltage from least to most was as follows: disrupted esophageal stethoscope (620 volts), the transesophageal pacemaker (640 volts), and the REF pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) (680 volts). Peak voltage measurements of the REF PAC significantly decreased from 388 +/- 23 to 142 +/- 22 volts (P < 0.0001, Student's t-tests) in a fluid medium compared to air. In a fluid medium, peak voltage significantly decreased from 142 +/- 22 to 85 +/- 15 volts (P < 0.0001, Student's t-tests) when the REF PAC was connected to the cardiopulmonary monitor.",
        "A study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of a preoperative fitting test for an implantable hearing aid in a virtual reality (VR) environment. High-resolution spiral computed tomography (CT) of the mastoid bone was performed, and the results of a mastoidectomy were simulated with manual segmentation on a standard medical workstation. CT was also performed on a temporal bone specimen obtained at real mastoidectomy, and the bone margins were segmented automatically with threshold-based techniques. A triangulated surface representation of the bone structures including the mastoid cavity was generated. These data as well as the computer-aided design (CAD) files of the medical devices were transferred into a VR environment. The CAD components of the hearing aid were manipulated to simulate the surgical implantation procedure. Merging CAD data of an implantable hearing aid with CT data of the temporal bone in a VR environment was shown to be a feasible method of providing three-dimensional information for the presurgical determination of fit and mountability. Advances in hardware and software are expected to improve the usability of this method. Although clinical studies are needed, these results may serve as an impetus for exploring the use of low-cost, widely available VR computer equipment in a potentially broad field of clinical applications.",

        "To determine the potential effect (electromagnetic interference) of cellular telephones on external cardiopulmonary monitoring devices.\nFor this study, we tested 17 different medical devices with 5 portable telephones (4 digital, 1 analog) to assess the potential for electromagnetic interference. The telephones were tested in a normal operating mode to simulate a typical hospital environment with patients or their families using their cellular phones. The medical devices were connected to the appropriate simulators for proper operation while the tests were under way. The screens and alarms of the medical devices were monitored while the telephones were maneuvered in the y and z planes near the devices. Clinically important interference was defined as interference that may hinder interpretation of the data or cause the equipment to malfunction.\nAny type of interference occurred in 7 (41%) of the 17 devices tested during 54.7% of the 526 tests. The incidence of clinically important interference was 7.4%.\nCellular telephones may interfere with the operation of external cardiopulmonary monitoring devices. However, most of the test results showed that the interference would rarely be clinically important.",
        "Polyvinyl chloride plastics (PVC), made flexible through the addition of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), are used in the production of a wide array of medical devices. From the late 1960s, leaching of DEHP from PVC medical devices and ultimate tissue deposition have been documented.\nA critical review of DEHP exposure, metabolism, and toxicity data from human and animals studies was undertaken. A brief analysis of alternatives to DEHP-plasticized PVC for use in medical device manufacture was completed.\nDEHP leaches in varying concentrations into solutions stored in PVC medical devices. Certain populations, including dialysis patients and hemophiliacs may have long-term exposures to clinically important doses of DEHP, while others, such as neonates and the developing fetus, may have exposures at critical points in development. In vivo and in vitro research links DEHP or its metabolites to a range of adverse effects in the liver, reproductive tract, kidneys, lungs, and heart. Developing animals are particularly susceptible to effects on the reproductive system. Some adverse effects in animal studies occur at levels of exposure experienced by patients in certain clinical settings. DEHP appears to pose a relatively low risk of hepatic cancer in humans. However, given lingering uncertainties about the relevance of the mechanism of action of carcinogenic effects in rodents for humans and interindividual variability, the possibility of DEHP-related carcinogenic responses in humans cannot be ruled out.\nThe observed toxicity of DEHP and availability of alternatives to many DEHP-containing PVC medical devices presents a compelling argument for moving assertively, but carefully, to the substitution of other materials for PVC in medical devices. The substitution of other materials for PVC would have an added worker and community health benefit of reducing population exposures to DEHP, reducing the creation of dioxin from PVC production and disposal, and reducing risks from vinyl chloride monomer exposure.",
        "During the acute inflammatory response to implanted medical devices, human neutrophils (PMN) release oxidative and hydrolytic activities which may ultimately contribute to the degradation of the biomaterial. In this study, the biological activities secreted by live PMNs which may contribute to biodegradation were investigated using a 14C label in the monomer unit of a poly(ester-urea-urethane) (PEUU) substrate. By using specific inhibitors, it was possible to propose a mechanism for PMN-mediated biodegradation. PMN, labeled with 3H-arachidonic acid, released significantly more 3H when adherent to PEUU than when adherent to tissue culture grade polystyrene (P<0.05). The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors, aristolochic acid (ARIST) and quinacrine (QUIN), decreased the release of 3H and inhibited PEUU biodegradation (>50%, P<0.05). ARIST had no effect on cell viability, whereas QUIN significantly decreased it. The serine protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride inhibited biodegradation, but did not decrease cell survival. There is evidence to suggest that activation via the PLA2 pathway caused the release of hydrolytic activities which were able to elicit 14C release from PEUU. The role of oxidative compounds which were released via activation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), was not apparent, since PMA inhibited biodegradation and cell survival (>40%, P<0.05). This study has shown that it is possible to find out the differences in PMN activation through the PLA2 pathway when exposed to different material surfaces, making this a model system worthy of further investigation.",
        "Regulatory stability testing requirements for various types of ophthalmic products, including eyedrops, eye ointments, ophthalmic inserts, injections, irrigating solutions, lens washes, and lenses, are not always straightforward. The International Conference on Harmonization (I CH) guidelines do not completely address all of the stability conditions required for these types of pharmaceutical products and medical devices; regulatory agencies around the world still differ on the exact data requirements, storage conditions (especially temperature and humidity conditions), and certain testing methods. These uncertainties make the development of a global ophthalmic product very difficult.

        "Neonatal surgical mortality has steadily fallen over the last five decades. Improved survival does not appear to be related to the introduction of new operative procedures. Most of the basic procedures were developed by 1960. Eight developments appear to be responsible: (1) The growth of pediatric surgery resulted in widespread availability of neonatal surgeons and dissemination of knowledge about newborn surgical emergencies. (2) The parallel growth of pediatric anesthesia, beginning in 1946, provided specialized intraoperative management of the neonate. (3) Understanding neonatal physiology is the key to successful management; major advances occurred between 1950 and 1970. (4) New inventions revolutionized patient care; the transistor (1947) made it possible for medical devices to sense, amplify and control physiologic responses and opened the communication and computer age. (5) Neonatal mechanical ventilation had a prohibitive mortality and was seldom utilized; the development of CPAP and a continuous flow ventilator in the 1970s allowed safe ventilatory support. (6) Total parenteral nutrition (1968) prevented starvation that frequently affected infants with major anomalies. (7) The effective treatment of infection began with the clinical use of penicillin (1941); antibiotics have reduced mortality but infants suffering from the septic syndrome have a prohibitive mortality; cytokine, proinflammatory agent research, and the development of anti-inflammatory and blocking agents in the 1980s have not affected mortality.

Our study introduces a new method of constructive medical technology assessment that can change the development and diffusion of a medical device to improve its later clinical effectiveness. The method, based on Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process, quantitatively supports discussions between various parties involved in technological development and diffusion. We applied this method in comparing a new blood pump with two competitors based on technical, medical and social requirements. These discussions changed the evaluators' perspectives, reduced diasagreements, and ended in a reliable evaluation of the pump's performance. On the basis of these results, adaptations were derived which improved the design and diffusion of the blood pump. This application shows the adequate potential of our method to steer technological development and diffusion of artificial organs.",

It is now generally accepted that noninfectious prion proteins are normally produced by the host and may undergo a conformational change to an abnormal, pathologic form, which appears to be responsible for disease symptoms. Many methods of decontamination and sterilization are claimed to be ineffective against prion proteins. Incidences of iatrogenic transmission of prions due to medical devices have been reported, and the recommended clinical practices when handling suspected cases are reviewed. Recent results with a peracetic acid based sterilant indicate that it may be a safe and effective means of prion inactivation on medical devices.",

The materials were expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), silicone sheet, and a monolayer of bovine endothelial cells (ECs) formed on glass, all of which are opaque materials used for artificial blood vessels and medical devices. According to quantitative analysis, the monolayer of ECs formed on glass had better blood compatibility than did either the ePTFE or the silicone sheet under shear flow conditions. Under a shear flow condition of 0.1 dyne/cm2, platelet adhesion was silicone sheet > ePTFE. In contrast, under a shear flow condition of 5.0 dyne/cm2, ePTFE > silicone sheet. These results indicate that the intensity of shear stress could modify the order of hemocompatibility of the materials. Therefore, direct observation of platelet adhesion under shear flow conditions is indispensable for testing and screening biomaterials and for providing a precise quantitative evaluation of platelet adhesion.",
        "The absence of pyrogens in injectable drugs is an indispensable safety control because contaminants causing fever pose a life-threatening risk to the patient resulting in the worst case in death by shock. When fever- inducing agents, i.e.pyrogens, come into contact with the immunocompetent cells in blood, these cells release mediators which transmit the fever signal to the thermoregulatory centre of the brain. The Phamocopoeia lists currently two test systems for pyrogenicity: 1. The in vivo rabbit pyrogen test which measures the fever reaction following injection of the sample to the animals. 2. The in vitro Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (LAL) which measures the coagulation in a lysate prepared from the blood of the horseshoe crab specifically initiated by endotoxins, i.e. cell wall components from Gram-negative bacteria. The new test presented here (PyroCheck) exploits the reaction of monocytes/macrophages for the detection of pyrogens: human whole blood taken from healthy volunteers is incubated in the presence of the test sample in any form, be it a solution, a powder or even solid material. Pyrogenic contaminations initiate the release of the \"endogenous pyrogen\" Interleukin-1beta determined by ELISA after a fixed incubation time. The technology presently listed in the Pharmacopoeia is limited to parenteralia (rabbit test: biologicals and pharmaceuticals, LAL: predominantly pharmaceuticals). In the EU Medical Devices Directive from 1995 the rabbit pyrogen test for medical products is in some cases requested. (in some cases LAL of an eluate from the device). However, pyrogen-testing needs to cover also innovative high-tech products such as medical devices (implants, medical plastic materials, dialysis machines), cellular therapies and species-specific agents (e.g. recombinant proteins). Here we report that the human blood test PyroCheck is suitable for testing filters in air quality control as well as for assessing medical devices and biocompatibility (dialysate fluid), i.e. that it can be extended to a wide spectrum of applications.",

        "2-Methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) was synthesised and then used in the preparation of crosslinked polymer membranes with lauryl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate and trimethoxysilylpropyl methacrylate (crosslinker) comonomers. Some physical aspects of the membrane properties were evaluated in order to establish the basis for the synthesis of a series of post-crosslinkable polymers. These materials were made by copolymerisation of the constituent monomers via a free radical method, and characterised using NMR, FT-IR, viscometry and elemental analysis. The optimum crosslink density and conditions required for curing coatings of these polymers were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and showed the inclusion of 5 mol% silyl crosslinking agent to be ideal. A nanoindentation technique was employed to determine if the coating developed elasticity upon crosslinking. The biological properties of the coatings were evaluated using a variety of protein adsorption assays and blood contacting experiments, and an enzyme immunoassay was developed to detect E. coli in order to assess the level of bacterial adhesion to these biomaterials. Polymers of this type were shown to be very useful as coating materials for improving the biocompatibility of, or reducing the levels of adherent bacteria to medical devices.",

        "The optimal therapy for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock remains controversial. Many protocols are followed, using different strategies for initial resuscitation, cardiovascular monitoring, hemodynamic intervention, and eradication of infection. Overall, an aggressive approach to the management of cardiovascular dysfunction in septic shock is warranted. Initially, large volume fluid resuscitation is instituted. Our first choice of resuscitation fluid is 0.9% normal saline. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring using a flotation pulmonary artery catheter as well as invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring is a necessity in the hemodynamic management of septic shock. If the patient remains hypotensive (mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg) after adequate volume resuscitation has been established (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 12 to 15 mm Hg), then vasopressor agents must be instituted. Our first choice is usually dopamine. In patients who remain hypotensive after maximal doses of dopamine are reached, norepinephrine is added. If these agents generate excessive tachycardia or if tachyarrhythmias develop, phenylephrine can be substituted or added. Inotropic agents are useful if the patient demonstrates hypotension with a low cardiac output state. Dobutamine is the agent of choice. We initiate broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics at presentation, modifying the exact regimen based on 1) site of infection; 2) prevailing organisms and antibiotic resistance patterns in the patient's environment; and 3) other specific risk factors (immunosuppression, chronic disease, exposure and vaccination history, invasive medical devices). When appropriate, aggressive surgical debridement is pursued. Currently, there are no clinical data to support the use of antagonists for sepsis mediators, although various clinical trials remain underway.

Although it started with insufficient support from the end-user management, a very tight scheduling and a moderate budget, the project developed into what is considered by all partners a success story. In particular, the development of the design software, called HIPCOM Interactive Design Environment (HIDE) was completed in a time shorter than any optimistic expectation. The software was quite stable since its first beta version, and once introduced at the user site it fully replaced the original procedure in less than two months. One year after the early adoption, more than 80 custom-made prostheses had been designed with HIDE and the user had reported only two bugs, both cosmetics. The scope of the present work was to report the development experience and to investigate the reasons for these positive results, with particular reference to the development procedure and the software architecture. The choice of TCL/TK as development language and the adoption of well-defined software architecture were found to be the success key factors. Other important determinants were found to be the adoption of an incremental software engineering strategy, well suited for small to medium projects and the presence in the development staff of a technology transfer expert.",
        "Management of many types of chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma relies heavily on patients' self-monitoring of their disease conditions. In recent years, internet-based home telemonitoring systems that allow transmission of patient data to a central database and offer immediate access to the data by the care providers have become available. However, these systems often work with only one or a few types of medical devices and thus are limited in the types of diseases they can monitor. For example, a system designed to collect spirometry data from asthmatic patients cannot be easily adapted to collect blood glucose data from diabetic patients. This is because different medical devices produce different types of data and the existing telemonitoring systems are generally built around a proprietary data schema specific for the device used. In this paper, we describe a generic data schema for a telemonitoring system that is applicable to different types of medical devices and different diseases, and show an implementation of the schema in a relational database suitable for a variety of telemonitoring activities.",
        "Case reports were received of a fatal tachycardia caused by a malfunction of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), a device that is subject to the tracking regulations of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The case reports led to a decision to notify 5,604 patients of the need for reprogramming of their ICDs to prevent the tachycordia. In the first 60 days, a total of 98.7% of the patients were successfully located and their devices reprogrammed. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine an extensive array of factors that might have been related to the time to reprogramming. Patient-specific factors such as age, sex, and ejection fraction did not serve as a barrier to reprogramming in the first week (p = NS). Patients whose regular physician had >5 patients with the ICD subject to the recall were significantly more likely to have their ICDs reprogrammed in the first week (odds ratio [OR] 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.85 to 2.43, p<0.001). Patients who changed physicians were significantly less likely to undergo reprogramming in the first week (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86, p<0.001). The experience of the recall of this tracked device is highly encouraging because it demonstrates that most tracked device recipients can be successfully located and receive medical intervention. Although tracking devices is a manufacturer's responsibility, the clinical community plays a critical role in its success. This report highlights the importance of understanding that role among physicians.",

        "This interim final rule with comment period changes one criterion and postpones the effective date for two other criteria that a new device, drug, or biological must meet in order for its cost to be considered \"not significant\" for purposes of determining its eligibility for transitional pass-through payments.  It also changes the transitional pass-through payment policy to include new single use medical devices that come in contact with human tissue and that are surgically implanted or inserted in a patient whether or not the devices remain with the patient after the patient is released from the hospital outpatient department.  These policies represent a departure from those presented in the April 7, 2000 Federal Register final rule with comment period entitled, \"Prospective Payment System for Hospital Outpatient Services.\"  This interim final rule with comment period also corrects a trigger date for grandfathering of provider-based Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) to conform with the intent not to disrupt existing FQHCs with longstanding provider-based treatment that we discussed in the April 2000 final rule.  Under the criteria in the April 2000 final rule with comment period, FQHCs are treated as departments of a provider without regard to the criteria for provider-based status in that document if they meet other criteria and were designated as FQHCs before 1995.  Under this correction, facilities that meet those other criteria and were designated as FQHCs or \"look-alikes\" on or before April 7, 2000 would continue to be treated as provider-based.

        "Viscosupplementation by means of intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid has been used to treat osteoarthritis of the knee. The proposed mechanisms of action result from the physical properties of hyaluronic acid, as well as from its anti-inflammatory, anabolic, local analgesic, and chrondroprotective effects. Adverse reactions from hyaluronic acid injections into the knee occurred in 8.3% of the 336 patients treated in one study, but at a rate of less than 3% per injection. Reactions were almost always local and generally resolved over 1 to 2 days. Hyaluronic acid injections were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a medical device; thus, the level of efficacy demonstrated is less than might have been required for approval as a drug. Several studies have failed to show statistically significant benefit compared with placebo. Furthermore, the treatment is relatively expensive; the cost of the drug for a series of injections is more than $500 per knee. Therefore, widespread use of these agents should be limited until more convincing data on their efficacy are available from well-designed clinical trials.",
        "Test data are presented for a novel chemical germicide formulation capable of sterilizing reusable medical devices in 30 minutes at 20 degrees C in an open tray. The tests conducted with this rapid-acting sterilizing solution (RSS) included sporicidal, mycobactericidal, and virucidal studies performed in accordance with Association of Official Analytical Chemist International or Environmental Protection Agency published guidelines, by using RSS stressed for as long as 7 days. Sporicidal assays were performed at 20 degrees C with a 30-minute exposure time by using both Clostridium sporogenes and Bacillus subtilis spores dried on porcelain penicylinders or suture loops (n = 60 carriers per treatment). For comparison, identical carriers were exposed to a commercial glutaraldehyde-based sterilizing solution stressed to a maximum-use time of 14 days and exposed per manufacturer's requirements (10 hours at 25 degrees C). The RSS sterilized 100% of the carriers of both spore types. The glutaraldehyde solution demonstrated 100% sterilization of C sporogenes -treated carriers but had difficulty sterilizing B subtilis spore-laden carriers (ie, no sterilization of suture loops and only 57% sterilization of porcelain penicylinders). Similarly, Mycobacteria bovis and selected fungal and viral agents were exposed to stressed solution for 5 minutes or less at 20 degrees C. In each case, the resulting log decrease in viable microorganisms significantly supported a claim for rapid high-level disinfection. Based on these data, RSS demonstrates high-level disinfection in 5 minutes and sterilization in 30 minutes at 20 degrees C.",

        "Physicians may receive various gifts and incentives from companies that make pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Although such incentives may benefit patients and physicians, they often pose serious conflicts of interest that violate a physician's professional responsibility. The physician-patient relationship is predicated on the physician acting in the best interest of the patient. The application of medical knowledge to complex clinical circumstances is difficult, even without biased sources of information and internal conflicts attributable to financial incentives. Yet, industry resources often are dedicated to the dissemination of information and incentives aimed to influence decisions not necessarily aimed at the goals of the patient. Physicians often are unaware of the nature of the incentives and commonly deny their demonstrated impact. Any incentive that is designed to impede, rather than enhance, the clinician's ability to make optimal patient care decisions is unethical for a physician to accept. These incentives should play no role in the practice of orthopaedic surgery.",
        "All commercially available silicone devices contain freely diffusible silicone oils, uncured oligomers, and other impurities (such as catalysts). These residuals have been found in quantities as high as 20% by weight in commercially available silicone medical devices. The fate and effects of these residuals have been the topic of much debate recently. In this study, a method for complete removal of these residual compounds was investigated. The total amount of extractable residuals was determined through exhaustive Soxhlet extraction of 5 silicone elastomers. LIM 6030 had 6.29%, LIM 6070 had 5.74%, Q7-4750 had 3.02%, Q7-4780 had 3.22%, and SE1935 had 0.13% extractables by weight. The amount of silicon containing residuals leaching from both the extracted and nonextracted samples was also evaluated for 3 and 18 days by inductively coiled plasma (ICP) analysis. A significant amount of leachable compounds, reported as microg Si/mg solid sample, was found in all nonextracted elastomers with the exception of SE1935 compared to blanks. The amount of leachable compounds found in the extracted elastomers was not found to be significantly higher than the amount found in the blanks. The residual compounds in silicone elastomers may be completely removed by exhaustive Soxhlet extraction and the resulting polymer does not leach silicon-containing compounds in vitro.",

        "(1) Infections following invasive endoscopy are rare and are usually of endogenous origin. Nevertheless, infections do occur due to inadequate cleaning and disinfection and the use of contaminated rinse water and processing equipment. (2) Rigid and flexible operative endoscopes and accessories should be thoroughly cleaned and preferably sterilized using properly validated processes. (3) Heat tolerant operative endoscopes and accessories should be sterilized using a vacuum assisted steam sterilizer. Use autoclavable instrument trays or containers to protect equipment during transit and processing. Small bench top sterilizers without vacuum assisted air removal are unsuitable for packaged and lumened devices. (4) Heat sensitive rigid and flexible endoscopes and accessories should preferably be sterilized using ethylene oxide, low temperature steam and formaldehyde (rigid only) or gas plasma (if appropriate). (5) If there are insufficient instruments or time to sterilize invasive endoscopes, or if no suitable method is available locally, they may be disinfected by immersion in 2% glutaraldehyde or a suitable alternative. An immersion time of at least 10 min should be adopted for glutaraldehyde. This is sufficient to inactivate most vegetative bacteria and viruses including HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Longer contact times of 20 min or more may be necessary if a mycobacterial infection is known or suspected. At least 3 h immersion in glutaraldehyde is required to kill spores. (6) Glutaraldehyde is irritant and sensitizing to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Measures must be taken to ensure glutaraldehyde is used in a safe manner, i.e., total containment and/or extraction of harmful vapour and the provision of suitable personal protective equipment, i.e., gloves, apron and eye protection if splashing could occur. Health surveillance of staff is recommended and should include a pre-employment enquiry regarding asthma, skin and mucosal sensitivity problems and lung function testing by spirometry. (7) Possible alternative disinfectants to glutaraldehyde include peracetic acid (0.2-0.35%), chlorine dioxide (700-1100 ppm) and superoxidized water. These are very effective, killing vegetative bacteria, including mycobacteria, and viruses in 5 min and bacterial spores in 10 min. An endorsement of compatibility with endoscopes, accessories and processing equipment is required from both the solution/device manufacturer and the endoscope manufacturer. Other important considerations are stability, cost and safety from the user and environmental standpoints. (8) Cleaning and disinfection or sterilization should be undertaken by trained staff in a dedicated area, e.g., SSD or TSSU. A suitable training programme is described. (9) If endoscopes are processed by immersion in disinfectants, harmful residues must be removed by thorough rinsing. Sterile or bacteria free water is essential for rinsing all invasive endoscopes and accessories to prevent recontamination. (10) If an automated washer disinfector is used it must be effective, non-damaging, reliable, easy to use and its performance regularly monitored. (11) If used, washer disinfectors and other processing equipment should be disinfected on a regular basis, i.e., between patients or at the start of each session. This will prevent biofilm formation and recontamination of instruments during rinsing. Disinfection should include the water treatment system, if present. (12) To comply with the Medical Devices Directive, manufacturers are obliged to provide full details on how to decontaminate the reusable devices they supply. This should include details of compatibility with heat, pressure, moisture, processing chemicals and ultrasonics.

        "The degree of exposure to DEHP was assessed in 11 patients with chronic renal failure undergoing maintenance haemodialysis. The amount of DEHP leached from the dialyser during a 4-h dialysis session was estimated by monitoring the DEHP blood concentration using a HPLC method. When a patient undergoes a dialysis treatment, the concentration of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in venous blood is increased when the blood crosses through the dialysis apparatus. This increase may be explained either because DEHP is not extracted by the dialyser or because DEHP comes from the dialysis bath due to contact of blood against plasticized pipes. To explain the increasing concentration of DEHP during treatment of renal failure using plasticized tubing, we propose a pharmacokinetic compartmental model in order to fit raw data obtained from dialysed patients and to get the amount of DEHP which enters the body by AUC calculations. Results obtained after HPLC analysis show a high degree of interpatient variability in DEHP retained. This amount can reach a toxicity level because of repetitive dialysis treatments over prolonged periods of time. In the coming years, it seems necessary to reconsider the use of DEHP as a plasticizer in medical devices. Highly unacceptable amounts of DEHP leached during the dialysis session could be easily avoided by careful selection of haemodialysis tubing.",
        "Reprocessing (repeated cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization) and reuse of single-use medical devices has been performed safely with some devices. The aim of our study was to analyze whether reprocessing of the Combitubes (Kendall-Sheridan, Argyll, NY) airway device, used for emergency endotracheal intubation and difficult airway management, is possible and can be performed appropriately and safely. Microbiological, microstructure, and material science examinations were performed with unused, as well as multiple reused and reprocessed Combitubes. The reprocessing procedure consisted of a cleaning, a disinfection, a final inspection, and a sterilization. Microbiological examinations of multiple reused and reprocessed Combitubes found no test organisms in quantitative cultures. A microbial reduction between four and five log levels compared with nonreprocessed tubes was found. Microstructure analysis for the examination of topographical alterations and changes in the chemical composition of the surface demonstrated nonsignificant alterations between new and reprocessed medical devices. In material science examinations, cuff burst pressures were not different between unused and multiple reprocessed Combitubes. The results of all examinations proved that the decontamination process is adequately effective, and that no significant superficial alterations are generated by the multiple reuse and reprocessing of the Combitubes. To assure uniformly good results, a quality management system must be established and only validated methods should be used.\nReprocessing of single-use medical devices offers the opportunity of significant savings and is already performed with some devices. Microbiological, microstructure, and material science examinations proved that reprocessing of multiple reused Combitubes (Kendall-Sheridan, Argyll, NY), mainly used for emergency airway management, is possible and safe.",
        "In medical device clinical studies, including therapeutic device and in vitro test assay method studies, the investigator is frequently interested in demonstrating the equivalence of clinical response, generally in continuous measurements, between a standard assay method and a new assay method over various occasions or times. The new assay method may be less invasive or more convenient or cheaper to use than the standard assay method. In this paper, several statistical approaches are discussed, including various repeated-measure regression models, the simultaneous 95% confidence interval for paired mean differences derived from Hotelling's multivariate T2 analysis for repeated-measure, paired data, repeatability and reproducibility studies, and concordance correlation coefficient.",
        "Bacterial colonization is the primary clinical problem faced by the surgeon and medical device innovator. Despite the absence of effective systemic treatment, medical implants and devices have been deployed with increasing success over the past five decades. Infection-resistant materials (IRMs) are a relatively recent addition to the science of implant and device development. The first IRM utilized leachable antimicrobial agents. Nonleachable technologies are being developed, some of which have the potential to make organ replacement even more successful in the future.",
        "Current efforts of new stent technology have been aimed largely at the improvement of intravascular stent biocompatibility. Among the chemical characteristics of metallic stents, surface oxide corrosion properties are paramount. Using our unique technique, the currently marketed 316 L stainless steel and nitinol stent wires covered with polycrystalline oxide were chemically etched and then passivated to form amorphous oxide. Excellent metallic-stent corrosion resistance with an amorphous oxide surface was demonstrated in our previous in vitro study. For in vivo validation, we compared the corrosion behavior of different oxide surfaces on various forms of test wires in the abdominal aorta of mongrel dogs using open-circuit potential and cyclic anodic polarization measurements. After conduction, the retrieved test wires were observed under scanning electron microscope. No passivity breakdown was found for wires covered with amorphous oxide, while wires with polycrystalline oxide showed breakdown at potentials between +0.2 to + 0.6 V. It has been proven that severe pitting or crevice corrosion occurred on the surface of polycrystalline oxide, while the surface of amorphous oxide was free of degradations in our experiment. We have demonstrated that this amorphous oxide coating on metallic material provides better corrosion resistance, not only in vitro but also in vivo, and it is superior not only in strength safety but also in medical device biocompatibility.",
        "Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms a bacterial biofilm by producing alginate when it adheres to mucosa or various medical devices. In this study, the effect of subminimal inhibitory concentrations (subMICs) of azithromycin (AZM) on the biofilm formation and in vitro adherence to polystyrene of 14 wild-type P. aeruginosa strains was studied. A total of 35 P. aeruginosa isolates from clinical specimens were used. Glycocalyx production was determined by the tube method, and bacterial adherence to the wells of flat bottom polystyrene tissue culture plates was estimated by the spectrophotometric method. Compared to the control, the adherence ability to polystyrene was inhibited by incubation with subMICs of AZM in a dose-dependent manner. These results support the findings of other investigators suggesting that AZM in subinhibitory concentrations may be useful in the prevention or treatment of biofilm-associated infections due to P. aeruginosa.",
        "The NIVEMES project creates an international network of Health Service providers which offer Telemedicine-Teleconsultation services to Remote, Isolated places and to ship vessels for both routine and emergency situations. The base of the system is the powerful Multimedia Health Record, with the ability to manage conventional data, images, videos and biosignals, acquired directly from the medical device. National and international medical codification schemata are employed such as ICD-X and WHO standards. Telemedicine and Computing in Health Care are rapidly covering a pending gap, not fulfilled by current bureaucratic and telematic procedures. However even from the first test fields conducted during the past year, it is obvious that a variety of new training needs has arisen. The users of such systems need to be instructed new ways of conducting their business, of taking advantage of the services, even a new way of perceiving health care provision. The user interface of the software is kept simple, thus getting acquainted with it requires minimum effort; however there are other issues on which training is required to best exploit the advantages the system offers. The telemedical networks spawned in each country must be co-ordinated, and the user needs to know where and how he/she will acquire the necessary support. Home-cared patients will have to operate medical devices and telemedical software, a task which although made easy from today's technology, it still requires some basic training, specially as far as elderly users are concerned. The NIVEMES system uncovers a set of new training needs, but it offers at the same time a vehicle for educating the professional health-carers. The Health Record comprises a multimedia, explicit account of the patient history, which can be used for detailed and integrated study from trainee health carers of all levels (as well as from officers on board, people taking care of home-confined patients and others), on real data or in a simulated environment. At the same time the telemedicine facilities may increase the effectiveness of junior doctors working in remote areas and enhance the confidence residents have about their local health centres. Systems like NIVEMES prove that new user needs arise nowadays and employment of modern tools requires training in modern methods and in a new way of thinking.",

This article examines the question of whether devices have enhanced placebo effects and, if so, what the implications may be. While the evidence of an enhanced placebo effect remains rudimentary, it is provocative and therefore worthy of further study. Suggestions are made, therefore, for how such an effect can be investigated without violating the principles of informed consent.",
        "The implantation of biomaterials elicits a host response that influences the long-term behavior of implanted medical devices. This foreign body response is governed by cells of the immune system. Because sexual dimorphism in the immune system is well-established, a comparative study of the foreign body response in male and female mice was initiated. Eight-week-old male and female Balb/c mice received two subcutaneous implants in the interscapular region of a smooth peroxide-catalyzed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and were sacrificed at 2, 14, 42, 70, and 105 days after implantation (n = 6 per sex per time point). Controls for each time point underwent the surgical procedure but received no implant. Tissue from the implant or surgical site was fixed, processed, and paraffin-embedded for histopathological evaluation and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta). In control animals, an inflammatory response was observed at 2 days that was decreased by 14 days and absent after 42 days. At 2 and 14 days after PDMS implantation, a mild to moderate inflammatory reaction was observed around implants. The peak response was seen at 14 days, and granulation tissue, composed primarily of fibroblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils, was first observed at this time. After 105 days, the implantation site was surrounded by mature connective tissue, which had minimal numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, with severity scores that did not differ significantly in males and females. The immunostaining for TNF-alpha and IL-1beta followed similar temporal patterns, with both reaching a peak at the two week time point and remaining elevated, compared to level of expression in the controls, throughout the 105 day observation period. Staining for both cytokines in the implanted animals was generally higher in females than in males, although this difference was significant only for IL-1beta. These results suggest subtle differences between males and females in the activity of peri-implant inflammatory cells.",
        "Medical devices and their associated process equipment must be reliable and fit for purpose. In light of the recent changes to the medical device regulations, manufacturers must now take an integrated approach to design, development and validation. Good design practice encourages this integrated approach while ensuring fitness for purpose within commercial reality. A review of current literature related to good design practice carried out in Part I of this paper showed that there is inadequate guidance regarding the integration of validation with design. This paper proposes a practical approach to design for validation aimed at making devices easier and more economic to validate. The approach comes in the form of a model of design for validation that illustrates the basic relationship between design, development and validation and a series of design tactics that were formulated in order to help designers take a more proactive approach to validation during design.",
        "To analyze the excess costs of medical care during the first decade after diabetes diagnosis, we surveyed two national incidence cohorts who contracted diabetes at age of 15-34 years and matched control groups from the general population of Sweden. Ninety percent of the diabetic subjects were on insulin treatment. Data on healthcare utilization and use of glucose lowering drugs and medical devices were collected via a questionnaire mailed to a recent cohort 1 year after diagnosis and a previously registered cohort 8 years after diagnosis. Costing was based on average national costs of hospital inpatient and out-patient care, an original study of daycare costs, and sales prices of the National Corporation of Swedish Pharmacies. One year after diabetes diagnosis, the annual excess costs of care were US$4743 among men and US$4976 among women (1997 prices). Hospital inpatient care accounted for more than 50% of the excess costs. Eight years after diagnosis, the excess costs were US$2010 among men and US$2734 among women. The higher costs for women were mainly related to hospital out-patient care, but also to more intensive self-monitoring. We conclude that diabetes in young and middle-aged people is a major economic challenge even before significant complications may have developed.",
        "Hematogenous candidemia is an increasingly frequent problem among patients who are immunosuppressed, receiving parenteral nutrition and/or antibiotics, or who have invasive medical devices such as indwelling catheters. In Brazil, Candida albicans was responsible for 53/145 (37%) of candidemia in 6 different tertiary care hospitals. The most common non-albicans species were C. parasilosis (25%), C. tropicalis (24%), C. rugosa (5%) and C. glabrata (4%). The main risk factors for infection were antibiotic use and the presence of a central venous catheter. The main risk factors for mortality were patient age (older patients at risk) and not removing the catheter. Because of the great number of non-albicans species and varied degrees of antifungal drug sensitivity, laboratory identification and sensitivity testing is very important. All patients with documented candidemia should be treated. Drugs to be used are amphotericin B and/or fluconazole. Fluconazole resistance is not yet a problem in Brazil, perhaps because it is rarely used as prophylaxis due to its high cost. Intravenous catheters should be removed immediately if the patient has a short term catheter, or if the patient is clinically unstable due to the infection and has a long term catheter in place.",

In a conventional grouping seven (7) ambulatory patients were found in early stages, twenty seven (27) occasionally hospitalized patients were found in intermediate stage and forty seven (47) hospitalized patients in terminal stage of cancer. The different samples were processed through routine mycologycal methods and the following fungi species were isolated and identified: fifty four strains (58%) of Candida albicans followed by eleven strains (11.8%) of Candida tropicalis, six strains (6.45%) of Candida parapsilosis, five strains (5.37%) of Candida krusei, four strains (4.3%) of Candida humicola and five strains (5.37%) of Rodothorula rubra. From medical devices like catheter tips, drainage catheters (Pen rouse, Foley) and gallbladder catheters; four (4) strains of C. albicans, three (3) strains of Rodothorula rubra and two (2) strains of Aspergillus sp were isolated. Of the Candida non albicans it was relevant to find C. krusei more frequently than Rodothorula rubra, Aspergillus sp and Penicillum sp. The frequency of the presence of fungi increases commensurately to the advancement of the clincal stage of the cancer.",

        "The Austrian healthcare system relies mainly on physicians in private practice and on various services provided by hospitals. The social health insurance scheme is compulsory, covering 99% of the population. The system is very decentralized. While the federal state provides the framework, the nine autonomous provinces are responsible for administering health and social services. There is ongoing public discussion about centralizing the healthcare system to make it more efficient and to enforce structural reforms. Because of concerns about healthcare expenditures, in 1997 the Performance-Related Hospital Financing System (LKF), a system similar to the diagnosis-related group system, was introduced for hospitals, including a plan for large medical devices. It is too early to evaluate the success of this new system, although some effects of the LKF system that could have been anticipated, such as shortened lengths of stay and more hospitalizations, have been seen. Previously, health technologies have been almost uncontrolled in Austria. The evaluation of health technologies as an instrument to support or to control their dissemination and use or to help define policies is not institutionalized or systematically used. It seems clear that structural reforms of the Austrian healthcare system are needed. Health technology assessment should be part of such reforms.",
        "There is currently an increasing interest in the use of DLC (diamond like carbon) films in biomedical applications. These investigations making use of DLC in the biomedical area indicate its attractive properties. In this study, we succeeded in depositing DLC on polymer substrates and found the best conditions and method for this application. We evaluated the blood compatibility of polycarbonate substrates coated by DLC (PC-DLC) under different conditions by using epifluorescent video microscopy (EVM) combined with a parallel plate flow chamber. Segmented polyurethane (SPU), which has been used to fabricate medical devices including an artificial heart, and proven to have acceptable blood compatibility, was compared with polycarbonate substrates coated with DLC film. The EVM system measured platelet adhesion on the surface of the DLC, by using whole human blood containing Mepacrine labeled platelets perfuse at a wall shear rate of 100 s(-1) at 1 min intervals for a period of 20 min. PC-DLC demonstrated that Tecoflex showed higher complement activation than PC-DLC. There were significant differences between the PC-DLC substrates. On the basis of these results, it is recommended for use as a coating material in implantable blood contacting devices such as artificial hearts, pacemakers, and other devices. This DLC seems to be a promising candidate for biomaterials applications and merits further investigation.",

        "The potential use of novel poly(sulfobetaine) copolymers as antibioadherent coatings was investigated using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model microorganism and human macrophages and 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Two well-defined statistical copolymers with narrow molecular weight distributions were prepared by group transfer copolymerization of n-butyl methacrylate (nBuMA) with either 10 or 30 mol % 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA). Sulfobetainized nBuMA-DMAEMA copolymers (poly[sulfobetaine-stat-nBuMA]) were obtained by treating these precursor polymers with 1,3-propanesultone under mild conditions. Both proton NMR spectroscopy and elemental microanalyses indicated that essentially all the DMAEMA residues were derivatized in both copolymers. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) discs were coated with the sulfobetainized nBuMA-DMAEMA copolymers and the bioadherent properties of these coated materials were compared with those of PMMA. Statistically significantly fewer (p<.05) bacteria, macrophages, and fibroblasts adhered to the poly(sulfobetaine-stat-nBuMA)-coated PMMA than to the uncoated PMMA. The poly(sulfobetaine-stat-nBuMA) copolymer containing the higher proportion (30 mol %) sulfobetainized DMAEMA residues proved to be the more effective antibioadherent coating. The antibioadherent properties of these coating materials may allow the cost-effective production of dirt-resistant, easy to clean work surfaces, bioinert coatings for medical devices, and antifouling coatings for marine, agricultural, and industrial applications.",

After each procedure, the bronchoscopist rated the performance of the medical device under study using a linear scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent and equal to that of a conventional flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope).\nMean performance ratings were > 4.0 (range, 4.17 to 4.63) for image clarity, illumination, lack of fogging, distal tip angulation, and ease of transnasal passage. All other ratings were > 3.0 (range, 3.54 to 3.87), the lowest of which was handling comfort.\nThe flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope with sterile single-use disposable-sheath endoscope system has the potential to reduce scope downtime by eliminating the need for high-level disinfection between procedures. Illumination, image clarity, and ease of insertion are very good, justifying future prospective studies comparing this device to conventional flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopes.",
        "We studied the attachment of astroglial cells on smooth silicon and arrays of silicon pillars and wells with various widths and separations. Standard semiconductor industry photolithographic techniques were used to fabricate pillar arrays and wells in single-crystal silicon. The resulting pillars varied in width from 0. 5 to 2.0 micrometer, had interpillar gaps of 1.0-5.0 micrometer, and were 1.0 micrometer in height. Arrays also contained 1.0-micromter-deep wells that were 0.5 micrometer in diameter and separated by 0.5-2.0 micrometer. Fluorescence, reflectance, and confocal light microscopies as well as scanning electron microscopy were used to quantify cell attachment, describe cell morphologies, and study the distribution of cytoskeletal proteins actin and vinculin on surfaces with pillars, wells, and smooth silicon. Seventy percent of LRM55 astroglial cells displayed a preference for pillars over smooth silicon, whereas only 40% preferred the wells to the smooth surfaces. Analysis of variance statistics performed on the data sets yielded values of p > approximately.5 for the comparison between pillar data sets and < approximately.0003 in the comparison between pillar and well data sets. Actin and vinculin distributions were highly polarized in cells found on pillar arrays. Scanning electron microscopy clearly demonstrated that cells made contact with the tops of the pillars and did not reach down into the spaces between pillars even when the interpillar gap was 5.0 microm. These experiments support the use of surface topography to direct the attachment, growth, and morphology of cells. These surfaces can be used to study fundamental cell properties such as cell attachment, proliferation, and gene expression. Such topography might also be used to modify implantable medical devices such as neural implants and lead to future developments in tissue engineering.",
        "Polymers are widely used for a large range of medical devices used as biomaterials on a temporary, intermittent, and long-term basis. It is now well accepted that the initial rapid adsorption of proteins to polymeric surfaces affects the performance of these biomaterials. However, protein adsorption to a polymer surface can be modulated by an appropriate design of the interface. Extensive study has shown that these interactions can be minimized by coating with a highly hydrated layer (hydrogel), by grafting on the surface different biomolecules, or by creating domains with chemical functions (charges, hydrophilic groups). Our laboratory has investigated the latter approach over the past 2 decades, in particular the synthesis and the biological activities of polymers to improve the biocompatibility of blood-contacting devices. These soluble and insoluble polymers were obtained by chemical substitution of macromolecular chains with suitable groups able to develop specific interactions with biological components. Applied to compatibility with the blood and the immune systems, this concept has been extended to interactions of polymeric biomaterials with eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The design of new biomaterials with low bacterial attachment is thus under intensive study. After a brief overview of current trends in the surface modifications of biocompatible materials, we will describe how biospecific polymers can be obtained and review our recent results on the inhibition of bacterial adhesion using one type of functionalized polymer obtained by random substitution. This strategy, applied to existing or new materials, seems promising for the limitation of biomaterial-associated infections.",

        "In this paper, we discuss the complex relationship between health technology assessment (HTA) and the regulation of medical devices and procedures. The relationship is first examined through a conceptual framework describing the itinerary from research to three levels of policy making: micro (standards of medical practice), meso (institutional rules), and macro (health policies). Four reports from the Quebec Health Technology Assessment Council (CETS) are used to illustrate how HTA activities can influence the regulatory mechanisms operating at each decision-making level. We then discuss the skillful balancing act required from HTA agencies to constantly negotiate the right distance from the regulatory process at which to operate. We propose that HTA agencies should not be incorporated into any regulatory, auditing, or monitoring process. Finally, the relationship between health technology assessment and health care reform is discussed. It is suggested that HTA activities will contribute most during the data-driven preparation and consolidation phases of a reform process. The fast pace of events and the political turmoil characteristic of the implementation phase provide a less receptive environment for HTA contributions.",
        "Platelet adhesion and spreading is suppressed when a poly(2-methoxyethylacrylate) (PMEA) surface is used, compared with other polymer surfaces. To clarify the reason for this suppression, the relationship among the amount of the plasma protein adsorbed onto PMEA, its secondary structure and platelet adhesion was investigated. Poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (PHEMA) and polyacrylate analogous were used as references. The amount of protein adsorbed onto PMEA was very low and similar to that absorbed onto PHEMA. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was applied to examine changes in the secondary structure of the proteins after adsorption onto the polymer surface. The conformation of the proteins adsorbed onto PHEMA changed considerably, but that of proteins adsorbed onto PMEA differed only a little from the native one. These results suggest that low platelet adhesion and spreading are closely related to the low degree of the denaturation of the protein adsorbed onto PMEA. PMEA could be developed as a promising material to produce a useful blood-contacting surface for medical devices.",
        "Several case-control studies have observed associations of implanted medical devices and certain connective-tissue and neurologic diseases.

Six cohorts were defined by implantation of medical devices (silicone, metal bone or joint implants, breast implants, penile implants, pacemakers, artificial heart valves), and four comparison cohorts were defined by surgeries not involving implants.\nWe observed associations that were generally consistent with previous reports, including associations of bone and joint implants with connective-tissue diseases, and an association of penile implants with idiopathic progressive neuropathy. We also observed associations of breast implants and pacemakers with connective-tissue diseases.\nFor the most part, our study confirms our previous case-control results. Although confounding by presurgical conditions (such as diabetes) remains a plausible explanation of the findings, several associations are worthy of more detailed research.",

        "Calcification is the leading cause of failure of a wide spectrum of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular medical devices. In this study our aim was to immobilize polyethylene glycol (PEG) and heparin on multiple crosslinked bovine pericardium with Glutaraldehyde (GA) and carbodiimide. Grafting of PEG and heparin through an intermediate tissue bound substrate containing aldehyde and imide functional groups showed reduction in calcification. In this experimental protocol, we used Golomb and Wagner's in vitro model for studying pericardial calcification and a diffusion cell with two compartments for evaluating the diffusion of calcium across the BP. The results showed that heparin immobilization on the surface reduces calcification independent of its concentration in the incubating medium. It is conceivable that inactivation of unpaired aldehydic moieties present in pericardium after exposure to GA act as potential site for PEG grafting and imide functionalities of EDC can covalently bind heparin, would be the key step in the prevention of calcification. It is well-established fact that heparin has a potent antithrombotic effect. But the exact role of heparin in the anticalcification process of bioprostheses still remain elusive.",

        "A main goal of surgical simulators is the creation of virtual training environments for prospective surgeons. Thus, students can rehearse the various steps of surgical procedures on a computer system without any risk to the patient. One main condition for realistic training is the simulated interaction with virtual medical devices, such as endoscopic instruments. In particular, the virtual deformation and transection of tissues are important. For this application, a neuro-fuzzy model has been developed, which allows the description of the visual and haptic deformation behavior of the simulated tissue by means of expert knowledge in the form of medical terms. Pathologic conditions affecting the visual and haptic tissue response can be easily changed by a medical specialist without mathematical knowledge. By using the personal computer-based program Elastodynamic Shape Modeler, these conditions can be adjusted via a graphical user interface. With a force feedback device, which is similar to a real laparoscopic instrument, virtual deformations can be performed and the resulting haptic feedback can be felt. Thus, use of neuro-fuzzy technologies for the definition and calculation of virtual deformations seems applicable to the simulation of surgical interventions in virtual environments.",

Adsorption of fibrinogen, IgG, and antithrombin (ATIII) from human citrated plasma on coated surfaces was evaluated by ELISA. Fibrinogen adsorption on coated ELISA plates was lower than that on bare polystyrene. There was no IgG adsorption on the HSA coating alone, but considerably high IgG adsorption was detected on the heparin-containing surface. The adsorption of ATIII increased with increasing heparin on the surface. The effect of multilayer coatings on platelets was tested by incubation of modified vascular prostheses with citrated blood. The most favorable interaction with platelets was observed on the HSA assembly. The interaction of platelets with the surface bearing unfractionated heparin was higher than that of the surface covered with partly depolymerized heparin.

Secondly, we will work through example applications of how to design and qualify processes of three levels of complexity which we call Empirical Overkill, Empirical, and Product Specific. Empirical Overkill is specifically for the microbial-control processes for indirect items, such as tanks, pipes, pumps and other hardware. Empirical is for pharmaceutical and medical-device products that are produced under good manufacturing conditions and, therefore, there is control of the level of the microbial bioburden. Product Specific is for microbial-control processes designed and qualified for a specific product on the basis of the numbers and resistance of the bioburden of that product. We will treat design in this report; however, the major thrust is in setting up and carrying out the biological qualification of the process, which is the mode of control used to assure the adequacy of these microbial-control processes.",
        "Concerns have been raised about interference of wireless local area network (LAN) systems and telemetry systems with medical devices in hospitals. The authors have investigated the susceptibility of 65 electromedical devices to a wireless LAN system and a telemetry system in preselected areas of a hospital. Testing was based on the American National Standards Institute Standard C63.18. The wireless LAN system operated at 2.42 GHz with an output power of 100 mW. The telemetry system operated at 466 MHz with an output power of 4 mW. Of the 65 devices tested, only two hand-held Doppler units, a Mini Doppler Model D900 (Huntleigh Healthcare Ltd) and a Ultrasonic Doppler Model 811 (Parks Medical Electronics, Inc.), were affected by the LAN system. Placed within 10 cm of the LAN system in standby mode, both units emitted periodic high-pitched beating sounds, which could be misinterpreted as normal beating sounds from the patient. These changed to random static noise during data transmission by the LAN. Under normal conditions of use, a LAN system would never be placed this close to a medical device. The quality of data transmission from the LAN system changed from \"good\" to \"acceptable\" in the colonoscopy room. This deterioration in transmission quality could have been caused by the lead shielding in the room. Electrosurgical devices operating at 0.5 to 1 MHz did not affect the LAN system at distances up to 3 m. None of the devices was affected by the telemetry system. These findings suggest that wireless LAN systems and telemetry systems can be acceptable for use in hospitals. Nevertheless, other systems should be tested on potentially susceptible devices by the hospital before use.",
        "We have applied a rat extracorporeal circulation (EC) model as an evaluation system for the immunotoxicity of medical devices in contact with the blood stream. Combining popular hemodialysis (HD) membranes [a non-biocompatible membrane, Cupurophane (CUP), and more biocompatible membranes, Cu-ammonium rayon (CAR) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN)] with rat EC, we evaluated the elicitation of acute and delayed immunological responses, as well as the effect of repeated EC. Acute effect markers such as the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and complement activity during EC, and delayed effect markers such as beta2-microglobulin (beta2-M), IgG, and complement 3 levels, were monitored. Acute markers after EC passage showed responses similar to those previously reported in patients with long-term hemodialysis such as TNF-alpha production and increased complement activity. Although beta2-M and IgG levels increased to 3- to 5-fold of the initial concentration within 4 weeks after rat EC, the trend of IgG increase was inversely correlated with membrane biocompatibility (CUP > CAR = PAN), but this did not occur for elevations in beta2-M (PAN > CAR > CUP). These data suggest that this EC model can reproduce similar immunological responses as seen in HD patients, and can be employed to evaluate medical devices and materials for their delayed, systemic, and repeated exposure effects with respect to immunotoxicity.",
        "4, 4'-Methylenedianiline (MDA) is a hydrolysis degradation product that can be released from polyurethanes commonly used in medical device applications. MDA is mutagenic and carcinogenic in animals. In humans, it is hepatotoxic, a known contact and respiratory allergen, and a suspected carcinogen. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to estimate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of MDA in patients exposed to MDA leached from the potting materials of hemodialyzers. A worst-case reuse situation and a single use case were investigated. The PBPK model included five tissue compartments: liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, slowly perfused tissues, and richly perfused tissues. Physiological and chemical parameters of a healthy individual used in the model were obtained from the literature. The model was calibrated using previously published kinetic studies of IV administered doses of (14) C-MDA to rats. The model was validated using independent data published for MDA-exposed workers. The PBPK results indicated that dialysis patients who are exposed to MDA released from dialyzers (new or reused) could accumulate low levels of MDA and metabolites (total MDA) over time.",
        "We describe a drug-delivery vehicle that combines the sustained release properties of liposomes with the structural advantages of crosslinked gelatin gels that can be implanted directly or coated onto medical devices. Liposome inclusion in gelatin gels does not compromise thermal stability nor does it interfere with the resiliency of gels to tensile force. However, electron spin resonance analysis of sequestered DPPC liposomes revealed a slight depression (ca. 1.0 degrees C) of the gel-to-fluid phase transition relative to liposomes in suspension. The level of liposome release from gels was determined by liposome concentration, liposome size, and the presence of poly(ethylene oxide) chains in the gel matrix or in the liposome membrane. Both neutral and charged liposomes displayed relatively high affinities for poly(ethylene glycol)gelatin gels, with only 10-15% release of initially sequestered liposomes while liposomes in which poly(ethylene glycol) was included within the membrane were not as well retained (approximately 65% release). The in vitro efflux of ciprofloxacin from liposomal gels immersed in serum was nearly complete after 24 h compared to 38% release of liposomal chlorhexidine after 6 days. The serum-induced destabilization of liposomal ciprofloxacin depended on the accessibility of serum components to gels as partly immersed gels retained approximately 50% of their load of drug after 24 h. In vivo experiments using a catheterized rabbit model of urinary tract infection revealed the absence of viable Escherichia coli on coated catheter surfaces in seven out of nine cases while all untreated catheter surfaces examined (n = 7) were contaminated.",
        "Bacterial infection is a frequent complication associated with the use of medical devices. In an effort to address this problem, antibacterial agents have been incorporated or applied directly onto the surfaces of numerous types of medical devices. This study assessed the feasibility of using a novel biodegradable polymer to release antibiotic drugs in response to inflammatory related enzymes. A model drug polymer was synthesized using 1,6-hexane diisocyanate (HDI), polycaprolactone diol (PCL), and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, ciprofloxacin. Polymers were characterized by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and elemental analysis. Biodegradation studies were carried out by incubating the polymers with solutions of cholesterol esterase (CE) or phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 30 days at 37 degrees C. The degradation was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry (MS) and 14C radiolabel release. Subsequently, the activity of the released antibiotic was assessed against a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. HPLC analysis showed the release of multiple degradation products which were identified, by tandem MS, to include ciprofloxacin and derivatives of ciprofloxacin. The microbiological assessment showed that the released ciprofloxacin possessed antimicrobial activity; 1 microg/ml was measured after 10 days. The results of this study suggest that these novel bioresponsive antimicrobial polymers or similar analogs show promise for use in the control of medical device associated infections.",
        "Rubber (cis-1,4-polyisoprene) is one of the most important polymers naturally produced by plants because it is a strategic raw material used in more than 40,000 products, including more than 400 medical devices. The sole commercial source, at present, is natural rubber harvested from the Brazilian rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis. Primarily due to its molecular structure and high molecular weight (> 1 million daltons) this rubber has high performance properties that cannot easily be mimicked by artificially produced polymers, such as those derived from, e.g., bacterial poly-hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). These high performance properties include resilience, elasticity, abrasion resistance, efficient heat dispersion (minimizing heat build-up under friction), and impact resistance. Medical rubber gloves need to fit well, be break-resistant, allow the wearer to retain fine tactile sensation, and provide an effective barrier against pathogens. The sum of all these characteristics cannot yet be achieved using synthetic gloves. The lack of biodiversity in natural rubber production renders continuity of supply insecure, because of the risk of crop failure, diminishing acreage, and other disadvantages outlined below. A search for alternative sources of natural rubber production has already resulted in a large number of interesting plants and prospects for immediate industrial exploitation of guayule (Parthenium argentatum) as a source of high quality latex. Metabolic engineering will permit the production of new crops designed to accumulate new types of valued isoprenoid metabolites, such as rubber and carotenoids, and new combinations extractable from the same crop. Currently, experiments are underway to genetically improve guayule rubber production strains in both quantitative and qualitative respects. Since the choice for gene activities to be introduced or changed is under debate, we have set up a complementary approach to guayule with yeast species, which may more quickly show the applicability and relevance of genes selected. Although economic considerations may prevent commercial exploitation of new rubber-producing microorganisms, transgenic yeasts and bacteria may yield intermediate or alternative (poly-)isoprenes suitable for specific applications.",
        "The Australian National Death Index (NDI) provides a comprehensive and accessible source of mortality information for epidemiological research. Use of the index requires a probabilistic matching process that inevitably results in some inaccuracy. In this paper, accuracy is assessed.\nResults of a matching process against the NDI performed by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in Canberra were compared with information provided by the Medical Device Outcomes study cohort and their families (n = 2,990). Indices of accuracy for the NDI were calculated.\nFor this particular study, the NDI has sensitivity 88.8% (84.9-92.8) and specificity 98.2% (97.4-98.7).\nThe relatively low sensitivity is of some concern to those using the NDI for health outcomes research. The importance of such a national database is evident; however, to improve accuracy the introduction of a national unique patient identifier is necessary.",

        "The rationale for preclinical testing of plastic materials for medical devices is the protection of patients from leachable toxic substances. A controversial and costly part of this testing is the use of animal in vivo procedures. The objective of the present study was to analyse the importance of in vivo tests in relation to the decision to approve or not to approve materials for use. A total of 1044 plastic materials were analysed by employing chemical, in vitro and in vivo tests: 5708 in vivo tests were performed. In only one out of 2650 systemic injection tests on mice did a material fail. As that material also failed in chemical tests, the systemic injection test had no influence on the decision not to approve the material. Intradermal irritation (2644 tests), implantation (398 tests) and sensitivity (11 tests) procedures on rabbits and guinea-pigs were the other in vivo tests. However, in all except three cases, the same decision on whether or not to use a material would have been reached without any of these in vivo tests. Thus, little security appears to be gained from the in vivo tests, and abandoning them would save resources, probably without any additional risk. ",

        "Modern sophisticated ultrasonographic equipment is capable of delivering substantial levels of acoustic energy into the body when used at maximum outputs. The risk of producing bioeffects has been studied by international expert groups during symposia supported by the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (WFUMB). These have resulted in the publication of internationally accepted conclusions and recommendations. National ultrasound safety committees have published guidelines as well. These recommendations and safety guidelines offer valuable information to help users apply diagnostic ultrasound in a safe and effective manner. Acoustic output from ultrasound medical devices is directly regulated only in the USA and this is done by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, there is also a modern trend towards self-regulation which has implications for the worldwide use of diagnostic ultrasound. It has resulted in a move away from the relatively simple scheme of FDA-enforced, application-specific limits on acoustic output to a scheme whereby risk of adverse effects of ultrasound exposure is assessed from information provided by the equipment in the form of a real-time display of safety indices. Under this option, the FDA allows a relaxation of some intensity limits, specifically approving the use of medical ultrasound devices that can expose the fetus or embryo to nearly eight times the intensity that was previously allowed. The shift of responsibility for risk assessment from a regulatory authority to the user creates an urgent need for awareness of risk and the development of knowledgeable and responsible attitudes to safety issues. To encourage this approach, it is incumbent on authorities, ultrasound societies and expert groups to provide relevant information on biological effects that might result from ultrasonographic procedures. It is obvious from the continued stream of enquiries received by ultrasound societies that effective dissemination of such knowledge requires sustained strenuous effort on the part of ultrasound safety committees. There is a strong need for continuing education to ensure that appropriate risk/benefit assessments are made by users based on an appropriate knowledge of the probability of biological effects occurring with each type of ultrasound procedure. The primary purpose of this paper is to draw attention to current safety guidelines and show the similarities and areas of general agreement with those issued by the parent ultrasound organisation, the WFUMB. It is equally important to identify gaps in our knowledge, where applicable.",

Samples (5 microl) were collected with a microcapillary pipette and evaluated using PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. Contact lens-wearing patients had a mean IL-6 level of 43.8 +/- 5.3 pg/5 microl compared with nondetectable IL-6 levels throughout the noncontact lens-wearing population. IL-6 in several patients removed from contact lens wear for 6 days became nondetectable. When these patients were returned to wearing lenses, IL-6 levels increased to their original levels within 24 h. The data presented indicate that an ocular medical device may stimulate IL-6 production.",

Digitized biomedical data and output from medical devices can be further modulated to a second audio program (SAP) subchannel which can be used for second-language audio in NTSC television signals. For long-distance transmission, we translate the digital biomedical data into the frequency domain using frequency shift key (FSK) technology and insert this signal into an SAP band. The whole system has been implemented and tested. The results obtained using this system clearly demonstrated that real-time video, audio, and biomedical data transmission are very clear with a carrier-to-noise ratio up to 43 dB.",

In this context the introduction of telemedical applications into the Medical Service will improve the quality of the medical care through better and faster access for the medical officer assigned to a unit or a ship for requesting support to expert knowledge from military facilities or the civilian sector. The telemedical system is based on a high-class commercial PC. This workstation can be extended as needed with medical devices (x-ray film digitizer, dermatoscope, otoscope) and allows linkage to other imaging methods (e.g., videocamera, ultrasound). Currently this system is under evaluation in a multi centre trial. The participants of this telemedical network communicate via EURO ISDN lines with sufficient bandwidth. If terrestrial lines are not available the communication will be based on satellite capacity. The application of internet-technology additionally provides access to medical data bases respectively allows civil-military co-operation and the interoperability between medical services of allied armed forces.

        "Among standard battery genotoxicity assays, the in vitro chromosome aberration test and the mouse lymphoma tk assay (MLA) yield about fourfold higher incidences of positive test results than the bacterial reverse mutation test or in vivo bone marrow tests. This is a result of experience with submissions of 335 new pharmaceuticals to the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices. While all of the standard systems have their value in detecting relevant genotoxins, there is no supportive evidence for DNA reactivity for a considerable number of in vitro clastogens and MLA positives. In particular the clastogenic response of such compounds is often associated with high cytotoxicity. This may invoke the need to change the approach to test for clastogenicity in vitro. A combination of measures such as (1) a change in the upper limits of cytotoxicity that are currently given in International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and Organization for Economic Co-Operation & Economic Development (OECD) guidelines, (2) the creation of a common ground of understanding for interpretation of in vitro (positive) test results, and (3) lowering the upper limits of test compound concentration irrespective of cytotoxicity may prove useful to ensure a sufficient reliability of genotoxicity testing with mammalian cells in vitro.",

        "A study was undertaken to evaluate different procedures to safely remove microorganisms, protein, and mammalian cells from materials and provide a suitable method for cleaning and assessing effectiveness of cleaning medical devices for reuse or for analysis of failure. Safety considerations for the personnel performing the cleaning or handling the device after cleaning are important issues. Polystyrene plates (96 well) were used to simulate device surfaces not amenable to manual scrubbing. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oral flora were grown in the plates. The plates were stained with crystal violet and the optical densities recorded. The results indicated that E. coli did not adhere well and Pseudomonas formed clumps that were easily detached from the surface of the plates. However, S. epi, C. albicans, and the oral organisms formed adherent biofilms that were difficult to remove from the plates. Detergents with enzymes and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) bleach were both effective in removing the biofilm. Other detergents and surfactants were not effective. The aldehyde agents did not remove the organisms and made further cleaning difficult. Allowing the biofilm to dry first made cleaning very difficult. Only the NaOCl bleach could subsequently remove the dried or aldehyde fixed organisms from the wells. The same 96-well polystyrene plate format was used to measure the amount of protein and cell adherence as well as the effectiveness of subsequent cleaning. Bradford reagent was used to detect protein as a measure of the cleaning efficacy. As with the bacteria, NaOCl bleach was effective at removing the protein and cells that had been dried or fixed by formalin or alcohol, whereas detergent with enzymes was not very effective. This study confirmed that used medical devices, contaminated with microorganisms, protein, and/or mammalian cells, should not be allowed to dry before cleaning and that a thorough cleaning procedure should precede sterilization or disinfection (with the exception of NaOCl bleach which also cleans).",

Membranes fabricated with PEO-b-PSF possess a hydrophilic surface. PEO-b-PSF segregates to the membrane surface during phase inversion fabrication of the membrane rendering the surface hydrophilic. Changes in surface hydrophilicity were demonstrated by a dramatic reduction in the dynamic contact angle in water. With regard to the similar microporous hollow fiber membranes, a PEO-b-PSF membrane had a dynamic water contact angle of 33 degrees +/- 2 compared to a 111 degrees +/- 3 for a polysulfone membrane. Studies on porcine platelet-rich plasma in vitro demonstrated that the hydrophilic PEO-b-PSF membrane was resistant to platelet adhesion compared to a polysulfone membrane. An order of magnitude fewer adherent platelets were observed on a PEO-b-PSF membrane compared to a polysulfone membrane. The hydrophilicity of PEO-b-PSF makes it a unique material for the fabrication of membranes for medical devices.",
        "Female urinals are designed to enable women to empty their bladders while not on the toilet and are therefore potentially useful in preventing incontinence. However, there is little published information to guide product selection. Therefore, an evaluation of these products was undertaken by the Continence Products Evaluation Network (funded by the Medical Devices Agency). All 13 reusable female urinals available in the UK in March 1997 were evaluated. Each urinal was evaluated by 28-32 community-based women. Preliminarily, each subject tested all urinals by trying to place them in one or two of their preferred positions, to establish if the urinals were suitable for full testing. Each of the urinals that were selected for full testing were then used for 1 week each. During this week the subjects kept a diary to record leakage or spillage when using the urinal. At the end of the week a product evaluation form was filled in to record product performance. The results from full testing indicate that all urinals were successful for some subjects. However, some urinals were found to be successful for all four main positions (e.g. Petal Female Urinal) while others were successful mainly in one or two positions (e.g. Bridge Saddle Pan and Subaseal). Many urinals were successful in the standing/crouching and sitting on the edge (of chair or bed) positions, while comparatively few urinals were successful in the lying position. It was found that the chances of finding a suitable urinal increased with levels of independence. This means that subjects with higher levels of dependency found fewer urinals to be suitable for their needs when used without assistance. The results of this evaluation provide guidance for product selection. However, it is recommended that continence specialists keep samples of the full range of female urinals to enable women to experiment with urinals in order to find one that best suits their needs.",

        "Natural rubber is a component of the latex of the tropical Hevea brasiliensis tree which is widely used in the manufacturing of medical devices and a large variety of articles for everyday use. Over a dozen allergens have been identified in the latex of H. brasiliensis. The allergens Hev b 1, Hev b 3, Hev b 6, and Hev b 7 are proteins that are involved in the biosynthesis of rubber or the coagulation of latex. Allergens that are part of the plant's defense system are represented by Hev b 2 and class I endochitinases. The allergens Hev b 4, Hev b 5, and Hev b 8-10 were classified as either structural or housekeeping proteins. Immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions to proteins present in Hevea latex were first described in 1927. Since then, natural rubber latex (NRL) allergy has become an important medical problem for an increasing number of individuals. Sensitization mainly occurs by wound or mucosal contact with NRL devices during surgery or by inhalation of airborne allergens released from powdered latex gloves. The number of surgical interventions and an atopic disposition are the most important risk factors for developing latex allergy, especially in children with spina bifida. Exposure to NRL products should be carefully avoided for individuals who belong to high-risk groups. Initial studies on establishing a latex-free environment for surgery in all spina bifida patients have reported on a decrease in sensitization and allergy to NRL.",

        "Many plastic surgeons develop technologies that are manufactured by Wall Street-financed companies. Others participate in the stock market as investors. This study examines the bioengineered skin industry to determine whether it integrates clinical and financial information as Wall Street tenets would predict, and to see whether the financial performance of these companies provides any lessons for practicing plastic surgeons. In efficient markets, the assumptions on which independent financial analysts base their company sales and earnings projections are clinically reasonable, the volatility of a company's stock price does not irrationally differ from that of its industry sector, and the buy/sell recommendations of analysts are roughly congruent. For the companies in this study, these key financial parameters were compared with a benchmark index of 69 biotech companies of similar age and annual revenues (Student's t test). Five bioengineered skin companies were included in the study. Analysts estimated that each company would sell its product to between 24 and 45 percent of its target clinical population. The average stock price volatility was significantly higher for study companies than for those in the benchmark index (p < 0.05). Similarly, buy/sell recommendations of analysts for the study companies were significantly less congruent than those for the benchmark companies (p < 0.05). These results indicate clinically unrealistic projections for market penetration, significantly high price volatility, and significantly high discordance among professional analysts. In all cases, the market is inefficient-an unusual finding on Wall Street. A likely explanation for this market failure is a cycle of poor clinical correlation when assigning sales projections, which in turn leads to price volatility and discordance of buy/sell recommendations. This study's findings have implications for plastic surgeons who develop new technology or who participate in the equities markets as investors. Plastic surgeons who develop new medical devices or technology cannot universally depend on the market to drive clinically reasonable financial performance. Although inflated sales estimates have benefits in the short term, failure to meet projections exacts severe financial penalties.

        "Porous polymeric media (polymer foams) are utilized in a wide range of applications, such as thermal and mechanical insulators, solid supports for catalysis, and medical devices. A process for the production of polymer foams has been developed. This process, which is applicable to a wide range of polymers, uses a hydrocarbon particulate phase as a template for the precipitation of the polymer phase and subsequent pore formation. The use of a hydrocarbon template allows for enhanced control over pore structure, porosity, and other structural and bulk characteristics of the polymer foam. Polymer foams with densities as low as 120 mg/cc, porosity as high as 87%, and high surface areas (20 m(2)/g) have been produced. Foams of poly(l-lactic acid), a biodegradable polymer, produced by this process have been used to engineer a variety of different structures, including tissues with complex geometries such as in the likeness of a human nose.",

        "Third-party reprocessing of medical devices labeled for single use is a safe, FDA regulated practice that helps hospitals reduce costs without compromising patient care. Simply because a device is labeled as single use does not mean it cannot be safely reprocessed. To the contrary, the single use label is chosen by the manufacturer, sometimes for economic gain, as there are no formal FDA regulations or standards to distinguish between reusable and single use devices. The current FDA regulatory framework for third-party reprocessors, which emphasizes compliance with FDA quality assurance requirements, is presently under review, and the agency is in the process of developing a new regulatory scheme for reprocessing.",
        "Chemical sterilants are used to high-level disinfect semicritical medical devices such as flexible endoscopes. For the chemosterilant to obtain a high level disinfection claim, The Food and Drug Administration requires demonstration of a 6-log reduction of myobacterial inoculum under worst case conditions (2% horse serum added to test sterilant). This testing requirement has led to label product claims of 45 minutes immersion times at 25 degrees C. Review of the scientific data suggests that at least an 8-log reduction in contamination with thorough instrument cleaning, followed by chemical disinfection for 20 minutes immersion at 20 degrees C will achieve high-level disinfection.",
        "Bacterial infection on implanted medical devices is a significant clinical problem caused by the adhesion of bacteria to the biomaterial surface followed by biofilm formation and recruitment of other cells lines such as blood platelets, leading to potential thrombosis and thromboembolisms. To minimize biofilm formation and potential device-based infections, a polyurethane (Biospan) matrix was developed to release, in a controlled manner, an antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) locally at the implant interface. One material set consisted of the polyetherurethane (PEU) base matrix radiofrequency glow discharge plasma deposited with triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (triglyme); the other set had an additional coating of poly(butyl methyacrylate) (pBMA). Triglyme served as a nonfouling coating, whereas the pBMA served as a controlled porosity release membrane. The pBMA-coated PEU contained and released ciprofloxacin in a controlled manner. The efficacy of the modified PEU polymers against Pseudomonas aeruginosa suspensions was evaluated under flow conditions in a parallel plate flow cell. Bacterial adhesion and colonization, if any, to the test polymers were examined by direct microscopic image analysis and corroborated with destructive sampling, followed by direct cell counting. The rate of initial bacterial cell adhesion to triglyme-coated PEU was 0. 77%, and to the pBMA-coated PEU releasing ciprofloxacin was 6% of the observed adhesion rates for the control PEU. However, the rate of adherent cell accumulation due to cell growth and replication was approximately the same for the triglyme-coated PEU and the PEU controls, but was zero for the pBMA-coated PEU releasing ciprofloxacin.",
        "Manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices have become integral partners with their customers in determining the quality of laboratory results. Design controls imposed by ISO 9001 quality system standards and various regulations require manufacturers to implement a formal design process, which begins and ends with customer requirements. For IVD systems, this means that manufacturers must establish analytical quality specifications as part of their design input. This provides greater assurance that commercial products will satisfy customer requirements. In the case of quantitative IVD measurement systems, analytical quality specifications include total allowable uncertainty (bias, imprecision, non-specificity). The primary source of customer requirements is the laboratory-customer, who should have established analytical quality specifications based on the needs of its physician-clients. The total allowable uncertainty budget is allocated in the design process to the individual components of the system, such as reagents, instrumentation, calibrators and accessories, and to other factors such as operator, specimen and environmental interactions. Their performance must collectively meet the total allowable uncertainty specification when they are finally integrated into a measurement system. The design control model requires objective evidence that design specifications have been met (verification) and, finally, that the system will satisfy the needs of its intended users (validation). Compliance with the quality system standards is monitored through independent audits, government inspections and post-market surveillance.",
        "Users of in-dwelling medical devices, prostheses and surgical dressings rely implicitly on their sterility. Rarely do consumers give any thought to what sterility really means. The general assumption is that manufacturers have adopted the most efficient and cost-effective methods of achieving sterility. Currently, terminal sterilization processes appropriate for the manufacture of medical devices are those that are deemed to give less than one chance in a million of a single, finished product item containing a viable organism. Such a definition of sterility is embodied in the European standard EN556 as a Sterility Assurance Level of 10(-6), based on the properties of heat-resistant endospores. However, is this level of sterility assurance appropriate for all categories of medical device? Moreover, do all medical devices which are labelled as sterile require the same level of treatment? This paper will demonstrate that in some instances, the high standards set for sterilization processing are unreasonable, not cost-effective and exclude new sterilization technologies from being accepted by the regulatory authorities.",
        "Preclinical evaluation of medical devices (prototype products) offers the opportunity to investigate and study the intended use of device materials. Preclinical evaluation programs are designed to determine the efficacy, safety, and biocompatibility of biomaterials, prostheses, and medical devices. The purpose of safety testing is to determine if a material presents potential harm to the human; it evaluates the interaction of the material with the in vivo environment and determines the effect of the host on the implant. Preclinical evaluation is the determination of the ability of the prototype product to perform with appropriate host response in a specific application, considered from the perspective of human clinical use. Therefore, preclinical data should include materials science and engineering, biology, biochemistry, medicine, host reactions and their evaluation, the testing of biomaterials, and the degradation of materials in a biological environment.",

The authors explain the need of careful elaboration and validation of the sterilization and aeration process incl assessment of ethylene oxide (EO) residues. The authors investigated the effect of the type of material and conditions of sterilization and aeration on the assessed EO concentration. For research of the behaviour of different polymers in the sterilization process model sterilizations of actual items of medical devices with a known composition proved more suitable than assessment in medical devices from medical institutions. The main conclusions of the investigation were a classification of polymers into those suitable and unsuitable for sterilization or resterilization, and attention was also drawn to poor reproducibility of results in old sterilizers, in particular those lacking effective aeration in aerators.",

For instance, it does not involve the grant of a marketing authorization by a medicines agency. Instead, a declaration of conformity is made by the manufacturer, but in many instances this is subject to approval by an independent certification house (known as a notified body). The Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC is applied in each EEA State by national Legislation.

The formation of adherent multi-layered biofilms embedded into a glycocalyx composed of exopolysaccharides on implanted devices is believed to be essential for the pathogenesis of S. epidermidis infections. Biofilm formation may be separated into primary attachment of bacteria to native or modified polymer surfaces followed by proliferation of attached bacterial cells leading to accumulation of multi-layered cell-clusters and glycocalyx formation. Recent progress in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms cooperating in S. epidermidis biofilm formation is reviewed and current thinking on the relevance of these mechanisms for S. epidermidis device-related infections is discussed.",
        "Many articles that document infections after improper decontamination of patient-care items have emphasized the necessity for appropriate disinfection and sterilization procedures. This paper provides recommendations on the preferred method for disinfection and sterilization of patient-care items based on the intended use of the item (i.e., critical, semicritical, noncritical). The chemical disinfectants recommended for patient-care items and instruments include glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, sodium hypochlorite, alcohol, iodophors, phenolics, and quaternary ammonium compounds. The choice of disinfectant, concentration, and exposure time is based on the risk of infection associated with the use of the item. The sterilization methods briefly discussed include steam sterilization, ethylene oxide, new low-temperature sterilization technologies and dry heat. When properly used, these disinfection and sterilization processes can ensure the safe use of invasive and noninvasive medical devices. However, this requires strict adherence to current cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization guidelines.",
        "Increasing data from a few sites demonstrate that information technologies can improve physician decision making and clinical effectiveness. For example, computer-based physician order entry systems, automated laboratory alert systems, and artificial neural networks have demonstrated significant reductions in medical errors. In addition, Internet services to disseminate new knowledge and safety alerts to physicians more rationally and effectively are rapidly developing, and telemedicine to improve rural access to specialty services is undergoing substantial growth. However, even technologies demonstrated to yield beneficial effects have not yet achieved widespread adoption, though the pace of change appears to be increasing as the Internet takes hold. Scientific evaluation of many technologies is also lacking, and the dangers of some of these technologies may be underappreciated. Research on the effects of specific technologies should be a priority. Policies should be developed to press information technology companies, such as pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, to recognize the importance of clinical evaluation. Research could also analyze the characteristics of effective technologies and of physicians and organizations who implement these technologies effectively.",

        "The preparation of hydrophobic polymer films (polyurethane and poly(vinyl chloride)) containing nitric oxide (NO)-releasing diazeniumdiolate functions is reported as a basis for improving the thromboresistivity of such polymeric materials for biomedical applications. Several different approaches for preparing NO-releasing polymer films are presented, including: (1) dispersion of diazeniumdiolate molecules within the polymer matrix; (2) covalent attachment of the diazeniumdiolate to the polymer backbone; and (3) ion-pairing of a diazeniumdiolated heparin species to form an organic soluble complex that can be blended into the polymer. Each approach is characterized in terms of NO release rates and in vitro biocompatibility. Results presented indicate that the polymer films prepared by each approach release NO for variable periods of time (10-72 h), although they differ in the mechanism, location and amount of NO released. In vitro platelet adhesion studies demonstrate that the localized NO release may prove to be an effective strategy for improving blood compatibility of polymer materials for a wide range of medical devices.",
        "To achieve the benefits of an Intelligent Operating Room (OR), we envision an OR control center--a voice-controlled network of medical devices. This central controller allows doctors and nurses to control many smart devices in a minimally-invasive OR, in the same way the operating system of a personal computer allows users to control computer peripherals, such as a printer or modem. Surgeons in the OR may use voice commands to control surgical devices when their hands are busy. In addition, the OR staff may use a touch-sensitive display panel to control any device in the OR from a single, convenient location. As an example, this paper describes a new 'operating system for the OR', called HERMES. Because of the unique demands of the Intelligent OR, the design of such a voice-control network involves several challenges: safety, reliability and ease of use. This paper discusses the design strategies for the HERMES control network and presents findings from the use of commercial HERMES in operating rooms.",
        "Natural rubber latex allergy is a serious medical problem for a growing number of patients and a disabling occupational disease among health care workers. Latex allergy develops from exposure to natural rubber latex, a plant cytosol that is used extensively to manufacture medical gloves, other medical devices, and numerous consumer products. Allergic reactions to latex range from skin disease to asthma and anaphylaxis that can result in chronic illness, disability, career loss, hardship, and death. There is no treatment for latex allergy except complete avoidance of latex. Patients and health care providers must be assured safety from iatrogenic sensitization and allergic reactions to latex. Therefore, the American Nurses Association supports immediate interventions to reduce the risk of latex sensitization and ensure safe outcomes for latex-sensitized patients and personnel in all health care settings. Successful interventions will require collaboration between health care providers and administrators, with support from the research community, government agencies, manufacturers, professional organizations, sensitized patients, and patient advocacy groups.",
        "Electronic article surveillance (EAS) is used in many applications throughout the world to prevent theft. EAS systems produce electromagnetic (EM) energy around exits to create an EM interrogation zone through which protected items must pass before leaving the establishment. Specially designed EAS tags are attached to these items and must either be deactivated or removed prior to passing through the EAS EM interrogation zone to prevent the alarm from sounding. Recent reports in the scientific literature have noted the possibility that EM energy transmitted by EAS systems may interfere with the proper operation of sensitive electronic medical devices. The Food and Drug Administration has the regulatory responsibility to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. Because of the possibility of electromagnetic interference (EMI) between EAS systems and electronic medical devices, in situ measurements of the electric and magnetic fields were made around various types of EAS systems. Field strength levels were measured around four types of EAS systems: audio frequency magnetic, pulsed magnetic resonant, radio frequency, and microwave. Field strengths from these EAS systems varied with magnetic fields as high as 1073.6 Am(-1) (in close proximity to the audio frequency magnetic EAS system towers), and electric fields up to 23.8 Vm(-1) (in close proximity to the microwave EAS system towers). Medical devices are only required to withstand 3 Vm(-1) by the International Electrotechnical Commission's current medical device standards. The modulation scheme of the signal transmitted by some types of EAS systems (especially the pulsed magnetic resonant) has been shown to be more likely to cause EMI with electronic medical devices. This study complements other work in the field by attaching specific characteristics to EAS transmitted EM energy. The quantitative data could be used to relate medical device EMI with specific field strength levels and signal waveforms. This is one of several efforts being made by the FDA, the electronic medical device industry and the EAS industry to mitigate the potential for EMI between EAS and medical devices.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) put in place a general ban on the use of chlorofluorocarbons for the products it regulates (medical devices, drugs, and foods) in 1978, exempting those products where chlorofluorocarbon use was determined to be essential for the public health. In the intervening years, as the international commitment to a full transition away from all chlorofluorocarbon use took shape under the Montreal Protocol, the FDA has worked with industry to facilitate the development and testing of alternative technologies and products for inhalation drug products. As these alternative products begin to move from testing through the approval process and into marketing, the FDA is working collaboratively with the Environmental Protection Agency, other governmental agencies, and nongovernmental stakeholders to develop a transition policy for the United States. The transition policy for metered dose inhalers must be one that achieves the dual aims of first protecting the patients who rely on these vital medical products, while also achieving the public health need of protecting the ozone layer. As a part of developing such a transition strategy, the FDA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in March 1997. The ANPRM proposed mechanisms by which the FDA could determine when chlorofluorocarbon use in a drug product could no longer be considered essential. The ANPRM resulted in a large amount of valuable public debate and input. The FDA is now working to incorporate the knowledge gained from these public comments as it continues the rule-making process.",
        "Residual endotoxins, commonly associated with bacterial biofilms colonizing reusable medical devices have been associated with pyrogenic reactions in patients. We have used a quantitative, sensitive and reproducible kinetic chromogenic adaptation of the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay to assess endotoxin recovery from an in-vitro bacterial biofilm. The 'recovery method' was based on a combination of physical treatment (vortexing and sonication) and chemical treatment (immersion in recovery solution). Five recovery solutions were investigated. The recovered endotoxin was greater when the biofilm was treated with a 1% SDS solution. The sensitive and reproducible method we have developed should allow the recovery and measurement of biofilm bacterial endotoxins on implanted and colonized medical devices. Moreover, the amount of endotoxin was sufficient (> 1000 endotoxin units/cm2 of substrate) to enable a substantial reduction by sterilization processes, the efficiency of which on biofilm endotoxins has yet to be proven.",

        "It is well known that reactive oxygen species such as O*2- and H2O2 induce the biodegradation or cracking of medical devices in vivo or that they are released from inflammatory cells activated by devices to oxidize low-density lipoprotein. Therefore, the development of a novel antioxidant is required to eliminate the reactive oxygen species. In this paper, we report that Mn-porphyrin derivatives containing a macromolecular Mn-porphyrin are relatively stable compounds that can eliminate O*2- and/or H2O2. The dismutation of O*2- in the porphyrins was determined using a cytochrome c-assay by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system and using the stopped-flow kinetic analysis technique. The possibility of porphyrins as scavengers of H2O2 was evaluated by in situ measurement with a Clark electrode. As a result, it has been found that Mn-porphyrin derivatives may be a vastly better scavenger of reactive oxygen species in vivo.",
        "Porous nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloys have demonstrated bone attachment as well as tissue ingrowth in the past. However, very few studies have compared porous NiTi soft and hard tissue reactions, and in vitro cell response. We therefore have evaluated the general muscle and bone reaction to porous nickel-titanium. The latter material was implanted in rabbit tibias and back muscle, and assessed after three, six and twelve weeks of implantation. Porous NiTi specimens did not cause any adverse effect regardless of both implantation site and post-surgery recovery time. Muscle tissue exhibited thin tightly adherent fibrous capsules with fibers penetrating into implant pores. We observed that attachment strength of the soft tissue to the porous implant seemed to increase with post-implantation time. Bone tissue demonstrated good healing of the osteotomy. There was bone remodeling characterized by osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity in the cortex. This general good in vivo biocompatibility with muscle and bone tissue corresponded very well with the in vitro cell culture results we obtained. Fibroblasts seeded on porous nickel-titanium sheets managed to grow into the pores and all around specimen edges showing an another interesting cytocompatibility behavior. These results indicate good biocompatibility acceptance of porous nickel-titanium and are very promising towards eventual NiTi medical device approbation.",

Termed aspirin-induced asthma, this reaction is potentially fatal. Asthmatics with chronic rhinitis or a history of nasal polyps are at greater risk. The reaction rarely occurs in children. Patients initially present with an acute episode of vague malaise, sneezing, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, and often a productive cough. Persistent rhinitis and nasal polyps may then develop. Asthma and aspirin sensitivity may appear in the following months. Within 20 minutes to 3 hours of taking a NSAID, aspirin-sensitive asthmatics can develop symptoms such as bronchospasm, rhinorrhoea, dyspnoea, cough, or urticaria-angiodema. NSAIDs (systemic or topical) should be used with caution in asthmatics and avoided in asthmatics with nasal polyps.

        "A bioartificial pancreas, a medical device entrapping islets of Langerhans (islets) in an immunoisolative membrane, has been regarded as one of the most promising approaches to treat insulin-dependent diabetic patients. In this study, various modifications of alginate-chitosan microcapsules were made such as the inclusion of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the use of crosslinkers such as carbodiimide (EDC) and glutaraldehyde (GA) in the core and onto the microcapsule membrane surface. A characterization of the modified microcapsules in terms of mechanical stability and albumin diffusion as well as their surface properties using SEM was performed. A mild GA treatment greatly enhanced the mechanical stability of the microcapsules, and this treatment did not affect the coating process of chitosan or PEG. The biological response to such microcapsules was evaluated by microencapsulation of red blood cells (RBC) and subsequent observation of their hemoglobin release. The encapsulated RBC in the PEG-GA coated microcapsules were found to be less hemolytic and had improved stability and biocompatibility. The results suggest the possibility of developing biological assist organs by microencapsulation of mammalian cells such as islets or liver cells in immunoisolative microcapsules in the near future.",

The fact that Congress did not expressly deny the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco cannot, Professor Merrill argues, be used to infer such authority.  This inference is particularly inappropriate in the case of tobacco regulation, he maintains, because there is compelling evidence that Congress had no intention of delegating this authority to the FDA.  He is unpersuaded that presidential approval legally sanctions the FDA's claim of authority by granting it a superficial political legitimacy.  Finally, he reminds us of the FDA's own repeated denials of jurisdiction over tobacco products, and he recalls the numerous times that Congress passed legislation directed at tobacco without granting the FDA any role in its regulation.  Professor Merrill's Essay, like the other pieces in this volume, was written after the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina decided Coyne Beahm v. FDA, but before a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed that decision in Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. FDA.

All practices performed at least one of a range of procedures requiring sterilization or disinfection, e.g., minor surgery 95%, cervical smear taking 98%, syringing of ears 98%. Only 76% of practices had a benchtop sterilizer and 39% did not have access to a sterile supply department (SSD); 32% of the latter had no desire to utilize such a service. Only 25% and 34% correctly identified the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) definitions of sterilization and disinfection respectively. The MDA Device Bulletin on benchtop sterilizers had been read by only 26% of respondents. There was an 86% interest in attending a workshop on sterilization and disinfection. The concepts and practice of sterilization and disinfection appear not to be clearly understood. We conclude that resources must be identified to provide appropriate education in this important area for primary care staff.",

        "Serious errors can occur with many medical devices (e.g., infusion pumps, ventilators, anesthesia machines), and even highly trained professionals can make critical errors. The FDA now requires that manufacturers consider the user when designing medical equipment and has issued a guidance document describing human factor (HF) problems and the HF design process. The Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation has also published guidelines, and the American Medical Association's National Patient Safety Foundation has selected reduction of medical errors as their mission. It is important that the medical community reinforce the patient-safety initiative by evaluating user-interface design and instructional manuals when purchasing such equipment. The payoff will be fewer incidents and less time required in device training. The FDA actively solicits help in identifying and reporting adverse events associated with medical devices. Health care practitioners employed by facilities subject to the FDA's user-facility reporting requirements should follow the user-reporting procedures established by their facility. Practitioners and users may want to directly report an incident to the MedWatch Program, the FDA's voluntary Medical Products Reporting Program.",
        "Fears that the dentist-supervised use of a product that contains carbamide peroxide and that emits hydrogen peroxide may not be safe from the viewpoints of toxicity and cancer risk were engendered by unrealistic animal tests. These fears prompted the UK Government Departments of Trade and Industry (DTI) and of Health (DOH) to try to prohibit the marketing of Opalescence (manufactured by Ultradent Inc.). Faced with the fact that Opalescence had already been awarded a CE mark under the EC Medical Devices Directive, the DTI and DOH attempted to bring about its prohibition by reclassifying Opalescence as falling under the EC Cosmetics Directive, according to which the marketing of products containing more than 0.1% hydrogen peroxide is not permitted.",
        "Electromagnetic interference (EMI) from radiofrequency (RF) sources can cause medical device malfunction. It has been proposed that such EMI be minimized by only operating sources of given RF powers when sufficiently separated from medical devices of given immunities. Such minimum separation criteria are estimated assuming free-space propagation, which is only valid in the ideal case. Yet proposed medical device EMC standards will require that minimum-separation criteria be listed in equipment manuals accompanying all new medical devices. It is essential that the practical utility of such minimum-separation criteria be evaluated. Fields due to an 800-MHz-type cellphone were measured in various rooms and corridors within an urban hospital, having both new (gyprock) and old (clay-block) wings. Data obtained from a calibrated antenna attached to a spectrum analyzer were repeatedly measured and averaged. Results were compared to those predicted by free-space propagation. Free-space predictions tended to overestimate measured fields in gyprock rooms and along corridors of both gyprock and clay-block construction. However, the free-space model tended to underestimate field levels predicted in clay-block rooms and in below-ground corridors. Usage of separation criteria to ensure EMC appeared useful in gyprock rooms and hospital corridors, but less so in rooms with clay-block walls or in below-ground sections of the hospital. This suggested that the latter regions should be considered as being special zones where side-by-side operation of RF sources and medical devices would require more conservative management (e.g., restriction or special approval of particular source or medical device).",
        "The soiling levels of patient-used narrow-lumened flexible endoscopes were assessed for bronchoscopes, duodenoscopes, and colonoscopes. The effect of cleaning on the soil composition and concentration was evaluated.\nSuction channels from 10 each of bronchoscopes, duodenoscopes used for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and colonoscopes were assessed immediately after patient use for the levels of bilirubin, hemoglobin, protein, sodium ion, carbohydrate, endotoxin, and viable bacteria. Another 10 suction channels of each type of endoscope were evaluated for the same components after routine cleaning but before processing by high-level disinfection or sterilization for subsequent clinical use.\nRecognizing that only soluble components could be quantified, the worst-case soil levels in the suction channels (the average surface area of these channels was 45.6 cm(2), 149.8 cm,(2) and 192.0 cm(2) for bronchoscopes, duodenoscopes, and colonoscopes, respectively) were protein 115 microg/cm(2), sodium ion 7.4 micromol/cm(2), hemoglobin 85 microg/cm(2), bilirubin 299 nmol/cm(2), carbohydrate 29.1 microg/cm(2), endotoxin 9852 endotoxin units/cm(2), and bacteria 7.1 (log(10)) colony-forming units (CFU)/cm(2). Colonoscopes had 4 to 5 times greater soiling on average compared with the other endoscope types. Routine cleaning reduced the levels of bilirubin to below the limits of detection for all endoscopes evaluated (limits of detection were <1 nmol/mL). After cleaning, residual hemoglobin was detectable in bronchoscopes only. After cleaning, the levels of protein, endotoxin, and sodium ion all were reduced fivefold to tenfold for all types of endoscopes. Carbohydrate was reduced to lower than the limit of detection for all endoscopes after cleaning, except the duodenoscopes. The average load of viable bacteria was reduced from 3 log(10) to 5 log(10) CFU/cm(2) (which represents 5.9-9.5 log(10) CFU/endoscope channel) after patient use to approximately 2 log(10) CFU/cm(2) (which represents 3.2-5.3 log(10) CFU/endoscope channel) after cleaning.\nThese data demonstrated that cleaning effectively reduced or eliminated many components of soil, but a substantial amount of viable bacteria and protein remained. Hemoglobin levels in before samples indicated that blood was not present in high concentrations in the suction channels of the majority of flexible endoscope samples. Soil that mimics the worst-case composition from patient-used endoscopes would be ideal for simulated-use studies for such medical devices.",

After a preliminary study, the following choices were made: isolator unit instead of a vertical laminar air-flow hood, rigid surface instead of flexible film, a multiple-unit structure (one half suit unit for storage and one isolator unit for passthrough, two preparation units, each with four double-gloving portals) instead of a single-unit structure. After the equipment was installed, the physical and microbiological processes were validated and a medical/pharmaceutical catalog of protocols was created. Then the technicians were trained and the standard operating procedures were written. Updated every six months, they describe the general organization, gaseous sterilization of the isolators, the drugs and the medical devices, prescription analysis and circuit, preparation of nominative forms and labels, double checking the preparations delivery, cleaning and maintenance, documentation and reports, waste disposal, safety and protection and instructions for emergency.

        "Microbial adhesion and biofilm formation on medical devices represent a common occurrence that can lead to serious illness and death. The process by which bacteria and yeast colonize open and closed implants is fairly complicated and involves a series of steps commencing with deposition of host substances onto the material. Prevention and treatment of established biofilms with antimicrobial agents are difficult because the organisms are encased within a protected microenvironment. Efforts to reduce adhesion using specially developed materials, such as hydrophilic or heparin coated, have had modest success once applied to the patient. The reason, at least for the most part, is the diverse milieu into which devices are placed and the multitude of ways in which organisms can colonize surfaces. A better understanding of the process is required, and the knowledge gained must be used to devise new strategies as alternatives to the traditional employment of antibiotics. These new approaches may still use antibiotics but at different concentrations (low to prevent and high to treat infection) and in a different manner (perhaps spiked therapy in which there is a delay between doses to reduce the risk of drug resistance and impact on normal flora). The possibility of applying functional foods to patient management should also be pursued.",

        "Near patient testing (NPT) was the norm in days when urine was examined by smell and taste. More recently, general practitioners and physicians in genitourinary medicine began to use light microscopes in their consulting rooms to examine urine for pus cells and urethral and other swabs for pathogens. Increasing knowledge has led to specialisation, however, with clinicians obtaining specimens for examination by others. Improved technology has speeded up the practice of medicine, raising expectations of patients and doctors alike, and reductions in the size and expense of testing instruments have made a renaissance of NPT possible. Such a rebirth has already been seen in high dependency units and neonatal intensive care units, where arterial blood gases and serum bilirubin have to be tested in less time than it would take a sprinter to reach the laboratory. People with diabetes, rushing about in the community, stop and test their own blood glucose to determine the ideal dose of insulin, and patients with asthma measure peak expiratory flow rates to titrate doses of inhaled and oral corticosteroids. To what extent has NPT developed in microbiology? General practitioners have nitrite dipsticks and dipslides with which to identify urinary tract infections and elsewhere in this issue the prospect for testing for Helicobacter pylori infection is discussed. Do-it-yourself HIV testing kits can be bought in some countries. Are these desirable developments for communicable diseases, the results of whose investigation are used not only to benefit the individuals tested but also to monitor trends in populations and determine policies for the prevention and control of infection? If NPT is desirable, or inevitable, in microbiology, how can it be developed so as to ensure a high quality service both for patients and the population? This review considers the implications of NPT in the field of communicable diseases for microbiology laboratories, quality assurance, accreditation, and the legal framework in which medical devices are used.",

Spinal anesthesia needles (102 units) and sheath components (61 units) were inoculated with a suspension of B. subtilis spores. After drying, the devices were sterilized with hydrogen peroxide gas plasma.\nHigher counts of aerobic, mesophilic, and fungal organisms were recovered when the drying period was insufficient. Anaerobic spores were not found in any analyzed presterilization items. The hydrogen peroxide gas plasma effected a 5 to 7 log10-fold reduction in B. subtilis spore counts in well-dried needles and sheath components.\nThe success of hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization depends mostly on educating the staff to assure well-cleaned and dried reusable medical devices, allowing penetration of the hydrogen peroxide gas plasma into the critical points of the items and providing a reduction in organisms.",
        "In testing for the cytotoxicity of medical devices, crucial parameters are the type of cells, the duration of the exposure, the physical form of the device and the method of evaluation. Using cell cultures the changes of cell functions induced by artificial materials may be evaluated. In screening tests the effect of biomaterials on functions common to all cell types is investigated through both continuous lines and primary cultures. In supplementary tests the effect of biomaterials on specific functions is studied, employing cells of the same type of those which will be in contact with the device in vivo. Osteoblasts, either from primary culture or an established line, are used to study the interaction with materials for bone implants. We evaluated whether dental cements affect the replication cycle of osteoblast-like cells MG63. The S phase was inhibited by the cements with a phenolic group, even though to a different extent. Mononuclear cell cultures are used to investigate the immune response, which is important in the host reaction to implant. We investigated whether the chromium ions released in a biological fluid may induce PBMC to produce cytokines involved in bone resorption. Chromium extract did not impair TNFalpha release significantly, but inhibited IL-6 release significantly in stimulated PBMC. Endothelial cell cultures are useful to the evaluation of materials for vascular grafts. We studied the influence of some types of Dacron on endothelial functions. Collagen-coated Dacron decreased significantly the production of 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1alpha). Knitted Dacron caused a significant increase of tissue factor, a significant reduction in PECAM-1 and a significant increase in ELAM-1.",
        "Uses of telemedicine are described and potential roles for pharmacists are discussed. Telemedicine has been defined as \"the use of electronic information and communications technologies to provide and support health care when distance separates the participants.\" Technologies included in telemedicine are videoconferencing, telephones, computers, the Internet, fax, radio, and television. Telepharmacy has the same basic definition but refers to pharmaceutical care provision. Although the videotelemedicine market is expected to grow considerably, lack of reimbursement and high costs are continuing obstacles. Pharmacy is using video-conferencing for education, training, and management purposes. The telephone has changed from a dial-and-talk instrument to a multimedia access tool. Medical devices are being attached to telephone lines to provide remote monitoring and therapy, and call centers are providing medication counseling, prior authorization, refill authorization, and formulary compliance monitoring. Although the Internet has quickly become a star performer, utilization by health care lags behind that of other industries. The Internet-fueled empowerment of consumers and their expectations for speed, access, and convenience are creating more unmet expectations of the traditional health care system. Pharmacy has both organizational and individual practitioner Web sites, but it is online drugstores that are attracting most attention. Potential benefits of telemedicine include improved access to care, greater efficiency in diagnosis and treatment, higher productivity, and market positioning for the coming century. Telemedicine will tax the economic, regulatory, legal, ethical, and clinical care expertise of the entire health care system. Studies of the effectiveness, cost, and societal implications of telemedicine are needed, along with practice models and standards, training programs, and solutions to regulatory, licensing, and legal questions.

        "Polyurethanes, having extensive structure/property diversity, are one of the most bio- and blood-compatible materials known today. These materials played a major role in the development of many medical devices ranging from catheters to total artificial heart. Properties such as durability, elasticity, elastomer-like character, fatigue resistance, compliance, and acceptance or tolerance in the body during the healing, became often associated with polyurethanes. Furthermore, propensity for bulk and surface modification via hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance or by attachments of biologically active species such as anticoagulants or biorecognizable groups are possible via chemical groups typical for polyurethane structure. These modifications are designed to mediate and enhance the acceptance and healing of the device or implant. Many innovative processing technologies are used to fabricate functional devices, feeling and often behaving like natural tissue. The hydrolytically unstable polyester polyurethanes were replaced by more resistant but oxidation-sensitive polyether polyols based polyurethanes and their clones containing silicone and other modifying polymeric intermediates. Chronic in vivo instability, however, observed on prolonged implantation, became a major roadblock for many applications. Presently, utilization of more oxidation resistant polycarbonate polyols as soft segments, in combination with antioxidants such as Vitamin E, offer materials which can endure in the body for several years. The applications cover cardiovascular devices, artificial organs, tissue replacement and augmentation, performance enhancing coatings and many others. In situ polymerized, cross-linked systems could extend this biodurability even further. The future will expand this field by revisiting chemically-controlled biodegradation, in combination with a mini-version of RIM technology and minimally invasive surgical procedures, to form, in vivo, a scaffold, by delivery of reacting materials to the specific site in the body and polymerizing the mass in situ. This scaffold will provide anchor for tissue regeneration via cell attachment, proliferation, control of inflammation, and healing.",
        "Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common causes of medical device-associated infections, including septicemic loosenings of orthopedic implants. Frequently, the microbiological diagnosis of these infections remains ambiguous, since at least some staphylococci have the capacity to reduce their growth rate considerably. These strains exhibit a small-colony phenotype, and often they are not detectable by conventional microbiological techniques. Moreover, clinical isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis adhere to polymer and metal surfaces by the generation of thick, multilayered biofilms consisting of bacteria and extracellular polysaccharides. This study reports improved detection and identification of S. aureus and S. epidermidis by an in situ hybridization method with fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for staphylococcal 16S rRNA. The technique has proven to be suitable for the in situ detection of staphylococci, which is illustrated by the identification of S. epidermidis in a connective tissue sample obtained from a patient with septicemic loosening of a hip arthroplasty. We also show that this technique allows the detection of intracellularly persisting bacteria, including small-colony variants of S. aureus, and the differentiation of S. epidermidis from other clinically relevant staphylococci even when they are embedded in biofilms. These results suggest that the 16S rRNA in situ hybridization technique could represent a powerful diagnostic tool for the detection and differentiation of many other fastidious microorganisms.",
        "A breathing system filter can remain connected to a laryngeal mask airway during recovery from anaesthesia. The Luer-lock monitoring port on the filter could be used for the delivery of supplementary oxygen. The efficacy of this technique was assessed in vitro by comparing the performance of two filters with four other devices, including a T-piece with a 40% oxygen injector. The minimum inspired oxygen fraction and pressure drop were measured over a range of ventilatory conditions and oxygen flows. The minimum inspired oxygen fraction measured with the remaining devices was greater than with the T-piece at an oxygen flow of 10 l.min-1. The pressure drop was greater with the breathing system filters than with the T-piece. A potential advantage in using filters is that no additional equipment is required. However, if using the filters as oxygen supplementation devices, there is only one port open to the atmosphere in the system and inadvertent obstruction of this port could cause barotrauma. It must be remembered that the nonstandard use of such equipment contravenes the recently introduced Medical Device Directive regulations.",

        "A long-standing goal of biomedical device development has been the generation of specific, desired host blood and tissue responses. An approach to meeting this design criteria is precise surface modification that creates micropatterns of distinct physicochemical character to direct cell adhesion and behavior. For this study, poly(ethylene terephthalate) films were coated with poly(benzyl N, N-diethyldithiocarbamate-co-styrene) and sequentially exposed to monomer solutions for photoirradiation. A photomask was placed over different regions to generate micropatterned surfaces with graft polymer stripes of three distinct ionic characters. Human monocytes were cultured on these surfaces to ascertain whether adhesion and fusion of monocytes/macrophages could be controlled. Nonionic polyacrylamide greatly inhibited adhesion and induced clumping of the few monocytes that did adhere. Macrophage adhesion and spreading led to high degrees of interleukin-13 induced foreign body giant cell formation on both the anionic poly(acrylic acid), sodium salt, and benzyl N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate portions of the culture surface. In spite of the highest observed levels of monocyte/macrophage adhesion on cationic poly(dimethylaminopropylacrylamide), methiodide, the adherent cells were not competent to undergo fusion to form foreign body giant cells. These results suggest that inflammatory cell responses may be spatially controlled in a manner that may be ultimately exploited to improve the biocompatibility of medical devices.",
        "Bacterial biofilms growing on implanted medical devices are difficult to eradicate, even with aggressive antibiotic therapy. However, application of ultrasound enhances the effectiveness of the antibiotic. The possible mechanisms of this phenomenon were explored in light of the observed influence of various ultrasonic parameters on the enhanced action of gentamicin against biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is postulated that ultrasound increases the transport of gentamicin through the cell membranes, which is the proposed rate determining step in killing by gentamicin. It is possible that the ultrasound perturbs the cell membrane and stimulates active uptake or permits passive uptake by temporarily disrupting the membrane or other structural cell components. The cell membrane disruption could be caused by high pressure, high shear stress, or cavitation. The dependence upon peak power density suggests that acoustic pressure plays a significant role. There is also a strong frequency component that causes the killing effect to decrease as frequency increases. A mathematical analysis of oscillatory shear stress on the cell shows that the magnitude of stress increases with frequency; thus, the hypothesis of oscillatory shear inducing antibiotic uptake is discounted. In addition, the shear displacement caused by shear forces is very small, so the shear disruption caused by oscillatory flow in an acoustic field has minimal impact. The experimental data also rule out the existence of transient cavitation in the bioacoustic effect. It is possible that stable cavitation and the accompanying microstreaming contribute to the bioacoustic effect.",

This is an undesirable situation, which can be corrected by limiting legal liability for those who opt to perform new medical procedures as part of clinical trials. By this means we shall encourage a more prudent and better regulated introduction of new technologies into medical practice.",

The organisms invariably form these biofilms on surfaces which have host proteins and other substances coating them. Once adherent, the bacteria multiply and anchor themselves in quite intricate structures which appear to allow for communication and information transfer between organisms. For the treating physician, many antibiotics are unable to eradicate dense biofilms, and therefore much work is required to devise ways to prevent their occurrence and clear them from the host.",
        "The current United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classification of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) as a B2 \"probable human\" carcinogen is based on outdated information. New toxicology data and a considerable amount of new mechanistic evidence were used to reconsider the cancer classification of DEHP under EPA's proposed new cancer risk assessment guidelines. The total weight-of-evidence clearly indicates that DEHP is not genotoxic. In vivo administration of DEHP to rats and mice results in peroxisome proliferation in the liver, and there is strong evidence and scientific consensus that, in rodents, peroxisome proliferation is directly associated with the onset of liver cancer. Peroxisome proliferation is a transcription-mediated process that involves activation by the peroxisome proliferator of a nuclear receptor in rodent liver called the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARalpha). The critical role of PPARalpha in peroxisomal proliferation and carcinogenicity in mice is clearly established by the lack of either response in mice genetically modified to remove the PPARalpha. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how, in rodents, peroxisome proliferation can lead to the formation of hepatocellular tumors. The general consensus of scientific opinion is that PPARalpha-induced mitogenesis and cell proliferation are probably the major mechanisms responsible for peroxisome proliferator-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents. Oxidative stress appears to play a significant role in this increased cell proliferation. It triggers the release of TNFalpha by Kupffer cells, which in turn acts as a potent mitogen in hepatocytes. Rats and mice are uniquely responsive to the morphological, biochemical, and chronic carcinogenic effects of peroxisome proliferators, while guinea pigs, dogs, nonhuman primates, and humans are essentially nonresponsive or refractory; Syrian hamsters exhibit intermediate responsiveness. These differences are explained, in part, by marked interspecies variations in the expression of PPARalpha, with levels of expression in humans being only 1-10% of the levels found in rat and mouse liver. Recent studies of DEHP clearly indicate a nonlinear dose-response curve that strongly suggests the existence of a dose threshold below which tumors in rodents are not induced. Thus, the hepatocarcinogenic effects of DEHP in rodents result directly from the receptor-mediated, threshold-based mechanism of peroxisome proliferation, a well-understood process associated uniquely with rodents. Since humans are quite refractory to peroxisomal proliferation, even following exposure to potent proliferators such as hypolipidemic drugs, it is concluded that the hepatocarcinogenic response of rodents to DEHP is not relevant to human cancer risk at any anticipated exposure level. DEHP should be classified an unlikely human carcinogen with a margin of exposure (MOE) approach to risk assessment. The most appropriate and conservative point of reference for assessing MOEs should be 20 mg/kg/day, which is the mouse NOEL for peroxisome proliferation and increased liver weight. Exposure of the general human population to DEHP is approximately 30 microg/kg body wt/day, the major source being from residues in food. Higher exposures occur occupationally [up to about 700 microg/kg body wt/day (mainly by inhalation) based on current workplace standards] and through use of certain medical devices [e.g., up to 457 microg/kg body wt/day for hemodialysis patients (intravenous)], although these have little relevance because the routes of exposure bypass critical activation enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract.",

        "This review discusses the state of neurology and the Internet at the turn of the millennium. First, some basic definitions about the Internet and its component protocols are presented. Next, ways neurologists and patients can use the Internet are enumerated. Internet resources or applications are available or are being created that can aid in the successful fulfillment of a neurologist's core professional activities: clinical care, teaching, research, and practice issues. Currently, the most useful categories of Internet resources for neurologists are electronic communication and access to knowledge bases. They fulfill needs that are not met by traditional, non-electronic media. There are many other types of Internet applications that supplement traditional medical methodologies. Finally, some problems and prospects concerning medical uses of the Internet are discussed: technological infrastructure including usability, security, meaning, validity/quality, value, outcomes, and responsibility. These issues must be successfully addressed if Internet computing is to become truly useful 'just in time' at the point of medical care. Solutions are actively under development today. The prospects are bright for neurology, and medicine in general, on the Internet. The Internet will become an essential medical device in the near future.",

        "The usefulness of a remote monitoring system that uses a personal handy phone for artificial heart implanted patients was investigated. The type of handy phone used in this study was a personal handy phone system (PHS), which is a system developed in Japan that uses the NTT (Nippon Telephone and Telegraph, Inc.) telephone network service. The PHS has several advantages: high-speed data transmission, low power output, little electromagnetic interference with medical devices, and easy locating of patients. In our system, patients have a mobile computer (Toshiba, Libretto 50, Kawasaki, Japan) for data transmission control between an implanted controller and a host computer (NEC, PC-9821V16) in the hospital. Information on the motor rotational angle (8 bits) and motor current (8 bits) of the implanted motor driven heart is fed into the mobile computer from the implanted controller (Hitachi, H8/532, Yokohama, Japan) according to 32-bit command codes from the host computer. Motor current and motor rotational angle data from inside the body are framed together by a control code (frame number and parity) for data error checking and correcting at the receiving site, and the data are sent through the PHS connection to the mobile computer. The host computer calculates pump outflow and arterial pressure from the motor rotational angle and motor current values and displays the data in real-time waveforms. The results of this study showed that accurate data on motor rotational angle and current could be transmitted from the subjects while they were walking or driving a car to the host computer at a data transmission rate of 9600 bps. This system is useful for remote monitoring of patients with an implanted artificial heart.",
        "A survey is given on analytical techniques currently applied to the surface characterization of biomedical polymers. The techniques include spectroscopies, thermodynamic and electrochemical measurements and microscopies, respectively. To illustrate the motivation for surface analysis, the hypotheses on the correlations between surface parameters and hemocompatibility of polymers are briefly examined. The applications of the examined methods are illustrated by a number of examples. These examples include the characterization of cellulose membranes (low-flux hemodialysis membranes) by streaming potential measurements and by inverse contact angle measurements. The use of surface spectroscopies (ATR-FTIR and XPS) is demonstrated by considering the optimization of surface modification procedures of vascular prostheses made from poly(tetrafluoroethylene). Furthermore, the characterization of water-swollen cellulose membranes by scanning force microscopy is shown. Finally, the extended application of physico-chemical surface analysis to the investigation of protein adsorption is considered. An example deals with in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry used to study the adsorption of fibrinogen onto a plasma-deposited hydrophobic fluoropolymer and onto poly(ethyleneoxide)-grafted fluoropolymer, respectively.",
        "Turf battles have always existed in radiology although recently, we have observed an increase in their numbers and sometimes in their virulence. The main reasons for this increase include the relative plethora of physicians especially in industrialized areas, and the rapid progress and development of medical technology and minimally invasive techniques. These turf battles risk interfering with the over-all medical costs of local health care systems as they will inevitably lead to an increase in the concentration of complex medical devices controlled by different specialties which, in turn, will lead to an increase in number of invasive and noninvasive, diagnostic and therapeutic examinations. The only way that radiologists can hope to maintain control of today's techniques will be if they are willing to offer qualitative expertise in their procedures with full clinical, academic and technological backing similar, or superior to that presented by our respective clinical and surgical colleagues. Furthermore, they should be fully involved in the decisional process and actual purchase of the technological equipment of their entire institution.",

A systematic analysis of the decision processes at the levels of licensing/market admission, coverage by statutory health insurance and steering of diffusion and usage reveals considerable inconsistencies in different health care sectors. With regard to different types of technology, an explicit licensing procedure conforming to international standards is required for drugs and medical devices.

        "Biomaterials which combine optimum properties of strength and biocompatibility are desirable in improving the long-term performance of implantable medical devices. Our study is aimed at developing technology designed to alter the outer atomic layers of a material to give the desired compatibility with the tissue while retaining the properties of the bulk substratum. Materials used in this study were titanium vanadium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) and cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy (Co-Cr). Soda lime glass discs and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) acted as controls. A cathode of either Ti-6Al-4V or Co-Cr was used to simultaneously deposit and implant identified substrata. The attachment of human bone-derived cells (HBDC) to various materials was determined using radiolabeling or colorimetric assays. Results show that HBDC adhere preferentially to the unmodified surfaces of Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-4V on glass compared to the unmodified Co-Cr surfaces and to that of the Co-Cr on glass. Depositing Ti-6Al-4V on Co-Cr gives significantly better attachment of HBDC than when depositing Co-Cr onto Ti-6Al-4V. While cellular attachment to the created surfaces reflects that of the cathodic materials, it is not identical to these materials. Ion deposition/implantation is capable of creating permanent surfaces which reflect the adhesion of source materials not bulk substrata.",

The protocol has been applied to several implantable infusion pumps and neurostimulators with associated attachments. Experiments were performed using a 1.5-T whole-body MR system with parameters selected to approximate the intended clinical and worst case configuration. The devices exhibited moderate magnetic field-induced deflection and torque but had significant image artifacts. No heating was detected for any of the devices. Pump operation was halted in the magnetic field, but resumed after removed. Exposure to the magnetic field activated some of the neurostimulators.",

We evaluated the resistance of various tympanostomy (pressure equalization [PE]) tube materials to biofilm formation using an in vivo model. PE tubes of silicone, silver oxide-impregnated silicone, fluoroplastic, silver oxide-impregnated fluoroplastic, and ion-bombarded silicone were inserted into the tympanic membranes of 18 Hartley guinea pigs. Staphylococcus aureus was then inoculated into the middle ears. An additional 8 guinea pigs were used as controls; the PE tubes were inserted without middle ear inoculation. All PE tubes were removed on day 10 and analyzed for bacterial contamination using culture, immunofluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All infected ears developed otitis media with otorrhea, but none of the animal control ears drained. Fluorescence imaging of the animal control tubes showed large cellular components consistent with inflammation. The infected tubes showed heavy DNA fluorescence consistent with bacteria and inflammatory cells. All animal control tubes except the ion-bombarded silicone tubes showed adherent inflammatory film on SEM. Also, all tubes placed in infected ears except the ion-bombarded silicone tubes showed adherent bacterial and inflammatory films on SEM. Nonadherent surface properties such as the ion-bombarded silicone may be helpful in preventing chronic PE tube contamination.",
        "Cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of self-limited gastroenteritis in the normal host but may cause severe disease in immunocompromised persons. Person-to-person transmission has been well documented in households, child care centers, and hospitals. Because contaminated environmental surfaces and medical devices such as endoscopes may play a role in disease transmission, we studied the susceptibility of C parvum to chemical agents commonly used for disinfection and evaluated the efficacy of sterilization processes.\nSeven disinfectants were studied at their use dilution using a suspension test. Antimicrobial activity was assessed with the use of a cell infectivity assay.\nAll sterilization processes tested (steam, ethylene oxide, Sterrad 100) inactivated 3 logs or greater of C parvum. The only liquid disinfectant/sterilant able to inactivate greater than 3 logs of C parvum was 6% and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide. Agents that did not completely inactivate C parvum included hydrogen peroxide at lower concentrations or exposure times, peracetic acid, sodium hypochlorite, a phenolic, a quaternary ammonium compound, 2% glutaraldehyde, and ortho-phthalaldehyde.\nMost high-level disinfectants used on endoscopes have limited efficacy against C parvum. However, the infectivity of C parvum on dry surfaces decreases rapidly. Therefore, current cleaning and high-level disinfection guidelines are adequate to prevent nosocomial transmission of C parvum by means of endoscopes.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been involved in the regulation of in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs or laboratory tests) since the introduction of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976. IVDs developed as kits or systems intended for use in multiple laboratories require review by the FDA before being marketed to ensure appropriate performance and labeling. IVDs developed as in-house, or so-called \"home-brew\", tests or laboratory test services are considered medical devices, but historically have not been subject to premarket review as a matter of enforcement discretion. FDA recently established a new regulatory paradigm for in-house tests based on classification of the active ingredients or building blocks of these tests as analyte-specific reagents (ASRs). ASRs are exempt from premarket review but subject to both manufacturing and labeling controls. Currently, genetic tests are received and reviewed by the FDA in the same manner as other in vitro diagnostic tests. The FDA currently is in the process of chartering a new genetics advisory panel to provide the agency with outside expertise to deal with genetic testing issues. We are also continuing to work with other agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services to determine how we can cooperatively help foster this important new area of testing.",

        "This article describes the simulation of the mechanical behavior of two types of endosseous-threaded dental implants and the development of design guidelines for such implants. Two- and three-dimensional representations, static and dynamic cyclic loads, different material models, axial loads, and loads directed at the occlusal angle are all used. A novel model of trabecular bone is used to incorporate fatigue effects. Directional material behavior, progressive bone loss, and partial osseointegration are also modeled. Bone support using muscle attachment is modeled using spring constraints as opposed to fixed constraints used in previous studies. The tapered thread design from Br\u00e5nemark Inc. exhibited higher stress levels in bone than those observed in the parallel profile thread from BUD Medical Devices, Inc. The BUD implant distributes stresses more evenly. Studies examining 25%, 75%, and 100% osseointegration showed cortical bone carried most of the load with resulting overload leading to crestal bone loss. Plots of stress showed that with increasing crestal bone loss, the majority of the load was transferred directly to the weaker trabecular bone tissue. Finally, it was shown that with proper implant redesign, loads can be transferred more evenly to the implant. This also improves fatigue life of the bone.",
        "Evaluation of mammograms for artifacts is essential for mammographic quality assurance. A variety of mammographic artifacts (i.e., variations in mammographic density not caused by true attenuation differences) can occur and can create pseudolesions or mask true abnormalities. Many artifacts are readily identified, whereas others present a true diagnostic challenge. Factors that create artifacts may be related to the processor (eg, static, dirt or excessive developer buildup on the rollers, excessive roller pressure, damp film, scrapes and scratches, incomplete fixing, power failure, contaminated developer), the technologist (eg, improper film handling and loading, improper use of the mammography unit and related equipment, positioning and darkroom errors), the mammography unit (eg, failure of the collimation mirror to rotate, grid inhomogeneity, failure of the reciprocating grid to move, material in the tube housing, compression failure, improper alignment of the compression paddle with the Bucky tray, defective compression paddle), or the patient (e.g., motion, superimposed objects or substances [jewelry, body parts, clothing, hair, implanted medical devices, foreign bodies, substances on the skin]). Familiarity with the broad range of artifacts and the measures required to eliminate them is vital. Careful attention to darkroom cleanliness, care in film handling, regularly scheduled processor maintenance and chemical replenishment, daily quality assurance activities, and careful attention to detail during patient positioning and mammography can reduce or eliminate most mammographic artifacts.",

        "The migration of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) from dialyzers was studied in 21 patients with chronic renal failure undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. The circulating concentrations of DEHP were measured by high performance liquid chromatography in blood of patients obtained from the inlet and the outlet of the dialyzer during a 4-h dialysis session. During treatment of renal failure using plasticized tubing, the plasma level of DEHP increased. On average, an estimated 75.2 mg of DEHP was extracted from the dialyzer during a single dialysis session, with a range of 44.3-197. 1 mg. On the other hand, the total amount of DEHP retained by the patient during the dialysis session was evaluated by the difference between the AUCout and the AUCin and ranged from 3.6 to 59.6 mg. The rate of extraction of DEHP from the dialyzer was correlated (r=0.705, P<0.05) with serum lipid content (cholesterol and triglyceride).So, we confirmed that patients on hemodialysis are always regularly exposed to considerable amounts of DEHP. However, several metabolic effects have been reported in various animal species following treatment with DEHP, such as changes in lipid metabolism and in hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activities. DEHP is now a well-known hepatic peroxisomal proliferator in rodents and an inducer of many peroxisomal and non-peroxisomal enzymes. So, lipid metabolism modifications and hepatic changes observed in hemodialysis patients could be explained from chronic exposition to DEHP. In the coming years, it seems necessary to reconsider the use of DEHP as a plasticizer in medical devices. Highly unacceptable amounts of DEHP leached during the dialysis session could be easily avoided by careful selection of hemodialysis tubing.",

        "According to the MDD (Medical Devices Directive) 93/42/EEC of 13 June 1993, medical products including gowns and drapes must provide a high level of protection for patients, users and others. The European Commission CEN/TC 205/WG 14, under the leadership of its convenor, Professor Werner, is developing a mandatory European standard on the basic requirements and test methods for disposable and reusable materials for protection of patients, surgical personnel, and operating room facilities i.e. gowns and drapes. This European standard is intended to clarify the situation with respect to products and their properties, defining basic requirements, for users and manufacturers of medical products. Future use of standard cotton textiles and conventional cotton-polyester mixed textiles is uncertain as they may not meet the requirements of the new standard, i.e. resistance to penetration by microbiological microorganisms, liquids and particle release. However, there are innovative reusable barrier surgical drapes and gowns which meet the basic requirements of the standard made from liquid repellent micro-filament materials, material laminates and perhaps some specific cotton polyester materials which have been chemically modified. In the new standard based on CEN/TC 205/WG 14, quality assurance for reprocessing of surgical gowns and drapes is critical. The manufacturer/distributor must use validated processes to prove that the requirements of this European Standard are met. Quality Assurance Systems will be required to give proof of decontamination, disinfection and sterilisation. Specified processes are to be used to maintain the properties of the materials throughout reprocessing. It is the responsibility of the hospital to assure optimal protection of patients and users. In case of a lawsuit, this could lead to the burden of proof being shifted to the hospital, with related risk of liability because it is always assumed that the work is being done according to the 'state of the art'. Difficult situations arise when it must be proved that one has acted equivalent to or better than the standard procedures and that no mistakes are made. Because of this risk of liability alone, the question of what surgical materials are used in the future should be considered very carefully.",

        "Tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (TZP) is a new interesting ceramic for the manufacture of medical devices. Its wide use in orthopedic and odontoiatric implants was limited till now by the high chemical and radiochemical impurities of the raw materials. Purification processes now available allow to obtain high purity ceramic grade powders suitable for TZP ceramics manufacture, even if their possible mutagenic and transforming effects are still unclear. The aim of this work is to study in vitro the mutagenic and oncogenic effects of a new zirconia ceramic stabilized by yttria (Y-TZP). This ceramic was sintered from high purity powders obtained by a process developed under a project carried out within the Brite EuRam programme. For comparison, ceramics made from unpurified zirconia powder were also tested. Fibroblasts irradiated by a linear accelerator were used as positive control. The results obtained show that Y-TZP ceramic does not elicit either mutagenic or transforming effect on C3H/10T(1/2) (10T(1/2)) cells and demonstrate that ceramic from high purity powders can be considered suitable for biomedical applications from the point of view of the effects of its radioactive impurity content.",

In many countries there is increased consciousness about latex sensitization. In the UK, the Medical Device Agency has been monitoring latex allergy for a number of years but has not found any conclusive evidence of any significant problem. We report following a detailed questionnaire study in two hospitals in the north-west of England. A total of 1,827 members of staff were questioned about latex allergy at work. One hundred and twenty-four (7%) of these hospital employees had experienced symptoms strongly suggestive of latex allergy. Of this group, 56 had a-RAST test (IgE specific to latex), which was positive in seven (12.5%). There was a history of atopy in 31%, and a family history of atopy in 17% of the individuals. As a result of the study it was found that 17% (21 of the affected individuals) had already changed their working practice by using latex-free gloves. We were able to increase awareness of latex allergy within the hospitals. Both individuals and health care organizations need to be aware of the problem and hospital organizations should encourage staff to seek guidance to address the problem and, if necessary, to take appropriate measures to improve working practices. Practical guidelines are given with regard to identifying the problem and glove use for hospital staff.",

An as yet-to-be particularized epitope of many complex substances sharing siloxane structures is presented through the MHC-II apparatus with development and retention of T cell memory. This memory can be tested for in practical terms using one or more forms of silica, which links the immuno-histopathology and autoimmune attributes of \"silicosis\" with those of \"siliconosis.\" The lesions of siliconosis are typical of those for persistent antigens and delayed, cell mediated hypersensitivity. The basic descriptive pathology of the reaction to silicone has been known since soon after introduction of silicones in medical procedures, with the exception of some details related to the more recent discoveries on the role of cytokines in the immunopathic process. The clinical consequences of siliconosis are common and can be severe in some individuals implanted with silicone devices.",
        "Pseudobacteraemia might be responsible for up to 50% of all positive blood cultures and its early recognition is important in order to avoid unnecessary treatment with antibiotics and delay in the search for the true cause of the fever. We describe pseudobacteraemia outbreak of Pseudomonas fluorescens related to contaminated lithium heparin bottles in a paediatric ward. Twelve patients were involved in this outbreak from December 1996-January 1997. All patients had no clinical evidence of sepsis, nevertheless most children were treated with antibiotics. Blood collection bottles were suspected as source of pseudobacteraemia and only lithium heparin bottles were found to be contaminated with P. fluorescences indistinguishable from the blood isolates taken from these children. Withdrawal of these bottles led to the termination of the pseudobacteraemia. Following discussion with the manufacturer, the contaminated batch of lithium heparin bottles was sent back for testing, and replaced with bottles containing dried lithium heparin. A hazard report was sent to the Medical Devices Agency (MDA). In order to minimize the possibility of this problem occurring again, the manufacturer has informed MDA that all lithium heparin solution is to be filtered to 0.2 micron prior to issue, in order to minimize bacterial contamination. Continued monitoring after the pseudobacteraemia showed no isolates of P. fluorescens from the blood of paediatric patients.",
        "Many studies have described the role of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in inflammation leading to atherosclerosis, a process in which alterations in the metabolism of cholesterol esters is well established. On the other hand, the mechanism of MDM activation in response to biomaterial surfaces is still not well understood. Several studies have described the different degrees of activation of monocytes on poly(urethane) surfaces by measuring the release of early markers of differentiation, such as cytokines. It has been possible to decrease MDM activation in contact with materials by modifying the material surface with antioxidants. Therefore, it has been proposed that it is the reactive oxygen species provided by MDM which are responsible for deleterious effects observed in material-derived inflammation. A recent study has shown that one of the markers of the degree of differentiation of MDM is the synthesis of cholesterol esterase (CE), an enzyme demonstrated as causing biodegradation of polyester(urethane)s and more recently polyether- and polycarbonate-poly(urethane)s as well. In this review article, markers used to assess MDM differentiation on material surfaces will be described and related to the activation of MDM. In particular, the CE accumulation in MDM which is associated with atherosclerosis will be related to its degradative potential during chronic inflammation. How this may impact on the biostability of implanted poly(urethane) medical devices is discussed.",

In response, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) established an Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) in 1992 to facilitate identification and evaluation of alternative and complementary therapies. Acupuncture, a therapy that has been used to treat disease in China for approximately 2,500 years has attracted considerable attention. NIH in a consensus statement derived from a Fall of 1997 consensus conference to assess acupuncture has indicated that acupuncture was useful in pain control and maybe a useful adjunct treatment for the management of asthma. Further, the US Food and Drug Administration has removed acupuncture from the \"experimental medical devices\" category.\nWe have extensively searched the literature for reports addressing the use of acupuncture in asthma treatment. We sought these using the National Library of Medicine, the Office of Alternative Medicine's database as well as other databases both English language based as well as other languages that catalog literature pertaining to alternative and complementary therapies. We then reviewed these reports and weighted the validity of the conclusions reached in the reports based on assessment of study design, number of subjects studied, duration of studies, types and number of controls, and statistical analyses used.\nData presently in the literature do not provide sufficient support for a useful role for acupuncture in asthma management.\nFurther properly designed clinical studies examining the use of acupuncture in asthma are extremely important and urgently needed.",

        "Custom-made prostheses are successfully used to treat particular pathologies such as congenital hip dysplasia. The new EC rules on medical devices require a complete technical dossier for each produced custom-made device counter signed by the surgeon who 'prescribes' the custom-made device. Thus, a specific pre-clinical validation protocol must be developed, considering the economical and temporal constraints imposed by the device type. As a first step, in the present study a protocol based on finite element analysis (FEA) was developed and validated, to verify each custom-made hip stem in terms of mechanical strength. The study was carried out on 12 custom-made cementless hip stem designs already produced and implanted, for which the 3D solid model was available. Two of the selected designs were used for the method validation, comparing strain gauges measurements with the stresses predicted by the finite element (FE) model. Once the proposed methodology was verified, all the remaining stem designs were analysed. The developed protocol made possible a complete analysis in less than 4 h; its accuracy (7-8% on the strain gauge measurements) was considered acceptable for the specific application.",

One of the measures taken was to review purchases for new equipment and where ever possible, choose equipment that could be sterilized using steam as opposed to using Ethylene Oxide sterilization. Medical device companies responded to the CFC ban by modifying the manufacture of delicate equipment to withstand the high temperatures used in steam sterilization.

Endotoxin is a critical measure for the presence of Gram-negative bacteria, known to cause endotoxemia. Cellular products are currently regulated as medical devices. Each location engaged in clinical protocols is responsible for establishing a quality assurance program.\nIn this study, endotoxin levels were assayed using both the gel-clot and kinetic chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assays on 33 patients' cellular products, produced in clinical laboratory settings as part of a clinical trial or approved protocol. These patient samples include tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (HSVtk). We sought to identify the more reliable and informative method for the determination of endotoxin levels in a variety of cellular products, to meet the growing demand for standardization of product quality assessment. Comparison of the most sensitive gel-clot LAL test (0.03 EU/mL), with the kinetic chromogenic LAL test, with a lysate sensitivity of 0.005 EU/mL, found many advantages of the more sensitive method.\nThe kinetic chromogenic LAL test, which has the greatest sensitivity, increased the percentage of samples with valid spike recoveries compared with the gel-clot LAL test from 65% to 70% at a 1:10 sample dilution; and from 81% to 88% at a 1:100 sample dilution. Ata sample dilution of 1:50 the kinetic chromogenic LAL test provided valid spike recoveries on 81% of all samples tested.\nIn the interest of providing the highest quality and safety in the finished cellular product, the determination of endotoxin by the kinetic chromogenic LAL test is a rapid, effective, easy-to-use method to detect the presence of Gram-negative bacterial contamination.",
        "Antimicrobial coating of medical devices has recently emerged as a potentially effective method for preventing device-related infections. The objective of this animal study was to examine in vivo the antimicrobial efficacy of prosthetic heart valve sewing ring fabric coated with: (i) silver; (ii) combined minocycline and rifampin (M/R); or (iii) combined chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol (CH/CX).\nA rabbit model of Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection of subcutaneously implanted fabric of prosthetic heart valve sewing rings was used. Following administration of anesthesia and preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, 0.5 x 0.5 cm samples of fabric were placed subcutaneously into the back of rabbits. Each rabbit received a total of eight samples: (i) two uncoated; (ii) two silver-coated; (iii) two M/R-coated; and (iv) two CH/CX-coated. After injecting a bacterial inoculum of 2 x 10(5) c.f.u. of S. aureus onto each implanted sample, the wounds were sutured. Rabbits were monitored daily for one week, killed and the test fabrics removed and cultured.\nRates of device colonization, device-related infection and device-related abscess were similar between the uncoated and silver-coated devices. Devices coated with M/R were less likely to be colonized or cause device-related infection when compared with uncoated devices, and less likely to be associated with abscess formation than silver-coated devices. There was a tendency for CH/CX-coated devices to be less colonized than uncoated devices. Only M/R-coated and CH/CX-coated devices produced zones of inhibition in vitro. Implantation of M/R-coated and CH/CX-coated devices in rabbits did not result in detectable systemic concentrations of the antimicrobial coating agents. Colonization of antimicrobial-coated devices was not associated with resistant S. aureus isolates.\nThese results suggest that silver-coated sewing rings may not prove to be clinically anti-infective. In contrast, antimicrobial-coated sewing rings that produce effective zones of inhibition, particularly those coated with M/R, are likely to be clinically protective.",

        "Bacterial infection of biomaterials represents one of the most important reasons for the failure of transdermal or implanted medical devices. The first and least understood step in biomaterial-associated infections is the initial interaction between bacteria and a surface. This initial interaction can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the physiochemical nature of the biological and synthetic surfaces, as well as the properties of the interstitial fluid. We have shown that atomic force microscopy (AFM) can be employed as an exquisitely sensitive and versatile tool for quantifying the interaction between bacteria and surfaces in physiological solutions. The forces of interaction between an AFM cantilever tip and a uniform lawn of bacteria immobilized on glass were determined. By comparing the interactions of cantilever tips with lawns of isogenic E. coli strains carrying genetic lesions that alter their cell surface composition, it was possible to evaluate the effect of macromolecules such as lipopolysaccharide and capsular polysaccharide on the adhesion process. Mutations that result in the synthesis of truncated lipopolysaccharide or in the overproduction of the negatively charged capsular polysaccharide colanic acid render the interaction of the bacteria with the AFM tip unfavorable due to increased electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, AFM could be used to evaluate the adhesion of bacteria onto commercially relevant biomaterials. In one approach, micron-size polystyrene beads were attached to AFM tips which were then used to measure forces. Unfortunately, this approach is limited by the meager number of materials manufactured as beads of a size suitable for AFM measurements. As an alternative approach, AFM cantilever tips were coated with a confluent layer of bacteria and used to probe planar surfaces. In this configuration, AFM could be employed to measure the force of interaction between virtually any bacterium and surface of interest.",

In 1992, SGBI-related reports accounted for 30.3% of the total 66,476 mandatory reports of adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse event in 1988, before the widespread publicity on breast implants, was implant burst or rupture. In contrast, in 1992 the most frequently reported event was reaction, a term used to describe a range of adverse effects.\nThe numbers of mandatory and voluntary reports of SGBI-related adverse events increased exponentially, as did the complexity of the reports, following publicity over the lack of safety data on breast implants and a short voluntary moratorium on their sale.

This article examines the case of a 34-year-old, mentally retarded man who experienced three episodes of hypothermia during recurrent exposure to pipamperone. After the pipamperone dose was largely reduced, no further hypothermic episodes occurred. Nine other cases of hypothermia with neuroleptic treatment were reported to the German Federal Institute of Drugs and Medical Devices from 1988 to 1997. A review of the cases revealed that nine of ten patients were treated with drugs that are potent antagonists of 5-HT2 receptors. In conjunction with experimental data, this suggests that antipsychotics with a strong 5-HT2 antagonistic component might be associated with hypothermia. Most of the newly developed \"atypical\" neuroleptic drugs belong to this group. Therefore, special attention for hypothermia is warranted during the use of \"atypical\" neuroleptics.",

A slightly hydrophobic heparin derivative which can be dissolved in organic solvent can be widely used in polymeric devices for clinical applications. In this study, hydrophobic heparin derivatives were prepared by coupling heparin with deoxycholic acid, cholesterol, lauric acid, and palmitic acid, respectively. The hydrophobicity of these heparin derivatives depended on the feed mole ratio of heparin to hydrophobic agents, and they showed good solubility in the co-solvent of acetone and water, as well as in water alone. Also, these heparin derivatives showed high anticoagulant activity. This approach for preparing hydrophobic heparin is expected to advance the drug delivery system by further extending the applications of heparin to medical devices such as cardiopulmonary bypass circuits, heart lung oxygenators, and kidney dialyzers.",

        "Medical devices equipped with position sensors enable applications like image guided surgical interventions, reconstruction of three-dimensional 3D ultrasound (US) images, and virtual or augmented reality systems. The acquisition of three-dimensional position data in real time is one of the key technologies in this field. The systematic distortions induced by various metals, surgical tools, and US scan probes in different commercial electromagnetic tracking systems were assessed in the presented work. A precise nonmetallic six degree-of-freedom measurement rack was built that allowed a quantitative comparison of different electromagnetic trackers. Also, their performance in the presence of large metallic structures was quantified in a phantom study on an acrylic skull model in an operating room (OR). The trackers used were alternating current (ac) and direct current (dc) based systems. The ac trackers were, on average, distorted by 0.7 mm and 0.5 degree by metallic objects positioned at a distance greater than 120 mm between the geometrical center of the sample and the sensor. In the OR environment, the ac system exhibits mean errors of 3.2 +/- 2.4 mm and 2.9 degrees +/- 1.9 degrees. The dc trackers are more sensitive to distortions caused by ferromagnetic materials (averaged value: 1.6 mm and 0.5 degree beyond a distance of 120 mm). The dc tracker shows no distortions from other conductive materials but was less accurate in the OR environment (typical error: 6.4 +/- 2.5 mm and 4.9 degrees +/- 2.0 degrees). At distances smaller than approximately 100 mm between sample and sensor error increases quickly. It is also apparent from our measurements that the influence of US scan probes is governed by their shielding material. The results show that surgical instruments not containing conductive material are to be preferred when using an ac tracker. Nonferromagnetic instruments should be used with dc trackers. Static distortions caused by the OR environment have to be compensated by precise calibration methods.",

They are considered to be medical devices, and the assessment of cytotoxicity is a necessary step in the evaluation of their biocompatibility. Extracts of six addition-type and six condensation-type silicones have been tested with L929 cells according to the ISO 10993-Part 5 standard. The cytotoxicity was evaluated by three different methods: neutral red uptake, propidium iodide (PI) staining, and amido black staining. According to the selected specific assay, contact between cells and material extracts was maintained for 24 h in the first series of experiments; then, considering that in vivo application of these materials is restricted to a few minutes, additional experiments were performed after 1 h of cell/extract contact. Analysis of the results showed that the addition-type silicones are nontoxic even when tested after prolonged exposure of the cells to the materials while the condensation-type silicones were cytotoxic at 24 h of incubation. Nevertheless, harm to the patient actually could be negligible, considering its very short time of exposure in vivo. This is supported by our finding that most are not toxic after 1 h. We suggest that the experimental conditions of cytotoxicity testing have to be relevant to the in vivo situation; accordingly, the time of exposure should be designed carefully.",

At least 90% (n = 77) of participants indicated they initially had learned how to operate the device, its purpose, function, and patient factors indicating use. Inadequate device knowledge was related to nurse stress, and being unsure how to use the device and fear of harming the patient were the two reasons most frequently identified as causing the stress. Six percent (n = 5) of staff nurses had used a device that caused patient harm.\nWhat RNs initially learn about medical devices may be related to how they learn, and the continuing increase in nurse use of medical devices has implications for all aspects of professional nursing: curriculum, teaching clinical nursing, continuing education and staff development, and research.",
        "In this paper we report a novel technique of DNA-polymer coating for gene transfer. A proprietary DNA polymer solution was used for thin-layer coating on a chromic gut suture as a model study. The coated sutures were characterized for physical properties such as coating thickness, mass of the DNA deposited on the suture, surface characteristics as determined by scanning electron microscopy, and in vitro DNA release characteristics under simulated physiologic conditions. The in vivo gene transfection using DNA-coated sutures was demonstrated in rat skeletal muscle and in canine atrial myocardium. A heat-stable human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) plasmid was used as a marker gene. Incisions of 1 to 1.5 cm were made in the rat skeletal muscles or the canine atrial myocardium. The sites were closed with either the DNA-coated sutures or control sutures. Two weeks after the surgery, the tissue samples adjacent to the suture lines were retrieved and analyzed for AP activity. The DNA-coated sutures demonstrated a sustained release of the DNA under in vitro conditions, with an approximately 84% cumulative DNA release occurring in 26 days. An agarose gel electrophoresis of the DNA samples released from the suture demonstrated two bands, with the lower band corresponding to the input DNA (supercoiled). It seems that there was a partial transformation of the DNA from a supercoiled to an open circular form due to the polymer coating. The tissue sites, which received the DNA-coated sutures, demonstrated a significantly higher AP activity compared with the tissue sites that received control sutures. In the rat studies, the mean AP activity (square root of cpm/microgram protein) was 43.6 +/- 3.3 vs 20.6 +/- 2.1 (p = 0.001) at the control sites. Similarly, in the canine studies, the AP activity was 73.6 +/- 7.4 Vs 21.6 +/- 1.4 (p = 0.0009) at the control sites. Thus, our studies demonstrated a successful gene transfer using our DNA-polymer coating technique. This technique could be useful for coating sutures used in vascular and general surgery, and also for coating medical devices, such as stents, catheters, or orthopedic devices, to achieve a site-specific gene delivery.",

        "The growing role of information technology in our society has changed the very nature of many of the tasks that workers are called on to perform. Technology has resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of proceduralized, rote tasks that workers must face. The impact of technology on many tasks and functions has been to greatly increase demands on the cognitive skills of workers. More procedural or predictable tasks are now handled by smart machines, while workers are responsible for tasks that require inference, diagnosis, judgment, and decision making. The increase in the cognitive demands placed on workers and the redistribution of tasks have created a need for a better understanding of the cognitive components of many tasks. This need has been recognized by many in the health care domain, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Recent FDA regulations encourage the use of human factors in the development of medical devices, instruments, and systems. One promising set of methods for filling this need is cognitive task analysis.",
        "\"This is an exciting time,\" says Eric Rechen, policy analyst in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Office of Device Evaluation (ODE). \"We're entering an era in which standards will have a more prominent role in the review of medical devices than ever before.\" During the past 10 years, there has been significant growth in the importance of standards in regulatory processes, as Donald J. Barth, regulatory staff manager for the Medical Products Group at Hewlett Packard Company, notes in setting the stage for discussion of the latest developments. Donald Marlowe, director of the FDA's Office of Science and Technology, and Rechen explain the use of standards in the regulatory review process as part of FDA efforts to ensure public safety in a time of shrinking agency resources. Marlowe discusses provisions of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 that allow manufacturers to submit a declaration of conformity to a standard to satisfy premarket review requirements. A guidance on the recognition and use of consensus standards, a list of recognized standards, and a list of frequently asked questions are available at the Web site of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) at www.fda.gov/cdrh and via the AAMI Web site at www.aami.org. The information is also available by telephone via CDRH Facts on Demand at 800-899-0381. Rechen provides details about the two new approaches for premarket notifications available under the new 510(k) paradigm. Manufacturers may demonstrate substantial equivalence through special and abbreviated 510(k)s in addition to traditional 510(k)s. A copy of the new 510(k) paradigm is available at the AAMI and CDRH Web sites and through Facts on Demand. As the FDA and many manufacturers enter the new world of abbreviated and special 510(k)s, Larry Kroger, GE Medical Systems, provides his comments based on the 4 years of experience manufacturers of diagnostic x-ray products have had with simplified 510(k)s. A comparison of the European conformity assessment procedures with the new 510(k) paradigm will appear in an upcoming issue of BI&T.",

The increase in incidence of potentially life-threatening allergic reactions to latex has been a cause for mounting concern over recent years. Although there have been recent reviews of the general problem of latex allergy, there is little advice available to anaesthetists on how to develop an effective strategy to implement within their own hospitals. The aim of this article is to improve awareness of latex allergy and by describing the development of our strategy to identify and safely manage those at risk in the peri-operative period, facilitate the process for other departments.",
        "The magnetic fields emitted by electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems (shoplifting gates) are a source of interference for implanted medical devices. In the Study of Pacemaker and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Triggering by Electronic Article Surveillance Devices (SPICED TEAS), 25 adult volunteers with ICDs and 50 with pacemakers were exposed to the fields of six different EAS systems. These EAS systems used three modes of operation: magnetic audio frequency, swept radiofrequency, and acoustomagnetic technology. No ICD exhibited interference mimicking sensing of tachyarrhythmias with any EAS system. Pacemakers interacted variably, depending on the type of EAS system. Swept radiofrequency systems produced no interaction with any implanted medical device. One magnetic audio frequency system interacted with 2 of 50 pacemakers. The acoustomagnetic system interacted with 48 of 50 pacemakers. Interactions included asynchronous pacing, atrial oversensing (producing \"EAS induced tachycardia\" in the ventricle), ventricular oversensing (with pacemaker inhibition), and paced beats resulting from the direct induction of current in the pacemaker (\"EAS induced pacing\"). These interactions produced symptoms in some patients (palpitations, presyncope) only while patients were in the EAS field. No pacemaker was reprogrammed. We conclude that high energy, pulsed low frequency EAS systems such as acoustomagnetic systems interfere with most pacemakers. Pacemaker patients should be advised to minimize exposure to the fields of such systems to prevent the possibility of serious clinical events.",

        "We have successfully developed a novel method to stably immobilize bioactive substances that have anionic groups, such as heparin and succinylated collagen (SC), on hydrophobic surfaces through ionic complexation using a polymerizable cationic lipid, diallyl(dioleyl)ammonium bromide (DADOA). It is composed of a hydrophobic part consisting of long hydrocarbon chains and a hydrophilic head with double bonds which render it polymerizable. Analysis of the modification with DADOA and heparin suggested that the modification formed a thin layer, roughly 60 nm in thickness, as a result of the spontaneous deposition of DADOA and heparin dissolved in water, through the hydrophobic interaction between DADOA and the surface and the ionic complexation between DADOA and heparin. The heparin deposition and its rate of release in plasma were 1.5 microg/cm2 and 0.0017 U/cm2/min, respectively. Cytotoxicity test results showed that the polymerization of the deposited DADOA rendered the modified surface stable and noncytotoxic. Further, antithrombogenicity and cell attachability test results demonstrated that heparin and SC were effectively immobilized on hydrophobic surfaces through ionic complexation. This method has proved useful for the modification of the hydrophobic surfaces of medical devices because the modification process can be performed under aqueous conditions without the use of organic solvents which induce crazing/cracking of plastic casings.",

A Microtox system was standardized and validated in our laboratory conditions. Our experiences with extract of pyrogenic cardiotomy reservoir, blood filter and systemically toxic (in mice) Barium methacrylate (monomer), and CIBA epoxy polymer materials established a positive correlation with Microtox system. Hence, the Microtox system gives adequate evidence as an alternative in vitro method to evaluate the toxicity of biomaterials and medical devices.",

        "The last decade witnessed rapid development of new communication technologies and their broad acceptance at large. Digital wireless telephones are the most popular example of these technologies. There are two aspects of these technologies that are related to human health and therefore biomedical engineering. First, antennas of some devices are in close proximity to the user's head, thus possibly producing locally excessive energy deposition. Second, radiofrequency (RF) signals emitted are amplitude modulated at extremely low frequencies, potentially eliciting different biological effects from those of unmodulated RF radiation. Recent progress in addressing these two issues is reviewed in this article. Another area of research and concern not covered here is electromagnetic interference (EMI) with medical devices. Considerable research has been conducted on the development of a new method for numerical and experimental evaluation of the spatial distribution of the power deposition in tissue. Improved implantable electric field probes and automated scanning systems are presently available. With respect to numerical evaluation of electric fields in tissue, the finite difference time domain (FDTD) technique has proven to be a useful and accurate tool. These developments also are critical in view of the regulatory requirements now imposed on mobile/portable transmitters. Similarly, significant research effort on biological effects of modulated fields has been undertaken. Most of the studies are still in progress, and further research agendas have been proposed.",

        "The coating of medical devices with antimicrobial agents has recently emerged as a potentially effective method for the prevention of device-related infections. We examined the anti-infective efficacy of intramedullary nails coated with an antiseptic combination of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol in a rabbit model of device-related infection after fixation of an open tibial fracture. The rabbits were randomized to receive 2.8-by-100-millimeter stainless-steel tibial intramedullary nails that either were uncoated or were coated with antiseptic. After administration of anesthesia and preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, a tibial fracture was created and then reduced with insertion of the intramedullary nail. A bacterial inoculum of 10(6) colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus was injected into the intramedullary canal, and the wound was sutured. Radiographs of the tibiae were made postoperatively, and the rabbits were monitored daily. They were killed at six weeks, or earlier if there was dehiscence of the wound, the fracture became grossly unstable, or the rabbit failed to thrive. The use of the antiseptic-coated nails was associated with a significantly lower rate of device-related osteomyelitis (two of twenty-two; 9 per cent) than the use of the uncoated nails (thirteen of twenty-one; 62 per cent) (p = 0.0003). The radiographic and histopathological findings were generally similar in the two groups of rabbits. Antiseptic agents were not detected in serum. The results suggest that antiseptic-coated fracture-fixation devices provide significant local protection against Staphylococcus aureus, which is the most common cause of infections related to orthopaedic devices.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to exempt panoramic dental x-ray units from the requirement that they be manufactured with exposure timers which automatically reset to zero upon premature termination of an exposure. Removing the automatic timer reset requirement will not compromise the quality of the radiographic image and will protect patients from being subjected to unnecessary radiation due to repeat radiographs. FDA also proposes five changes to align the performance standard with the equipment requirements issued under the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA). First, the agency proposes to remove any reference to the use of equipment not specifically designed for mammography from the performance requirements for mammography equipment. Second, FDA proposes that the mammographic field alignment requirements restrict the irradiation beam to less than 2 percent of the source-image receptor distance (SID) beyond the image receptor edges. Third, it is proposed that the definition of an image receptor support device be amended to specify that it must provide a primary protective barrier for any orientation of the x-ray tube and image receptor support device assembly. Fourth, it is proposed that the useful beam must be confined to the dimensions of the primary barrier provided by the image receptor support device (except on the chest wall side). Fifth, it is proposed that exposures not be permitted without the primary barrier in place.",
        "Clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci often elaborate a biofilm involved in adherence to medical devices and resistance to host defenses. The biofilm contains the capsular polysaccharide/adhesin (PS/A), which mediates cell adherence to biomaterials, and another antigen, termed polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), which is thought to mediate bacterial accumulation into cellular aggregates. PIA is a polymer of beta-1, 6-linked N-acetyl glucosamine residues with a molecular mass of <30, 000 kDa. We found that recombinant Staphylococcus carnosus and Staphylococcus aureus carrying a plasmid with genes of the ica locus, which was reported to encode the biosynthetic proteins for production of PIA, were also able to synthesize PS/A. PS/A and a chemically and immunologically identical polysaccharide isolated from S. carnosus carrying the ica genes on plasmid pCN27 were found to be high-molecular-mass (>250,000 kDa), acid-stable polymers of beta-1,6-linked glucosamine substituted on the amino group primarily with succinate, although some preparations also contained acetate. Moreover, all recombinant staphylococcal strains with the ica genes had the biologic properties previously attributed to PS/A. ica-positive strains readily formed an in vitro biofilm on plastic, adhered 3- to 10-fold more to catheters during a 30-min assay compared with control strains carrying only the cloning vector, adsorbed out antibodies to PS/A from immune serum, and elaborated a capsule visualized by immunoelectron microscopy with antisera to PS/A. These properties were also seen with PS/A-producing strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, but not with transposon mutants lacking PS/A. An antiserum raised to PIA contained high-titer antibody to PS/A that was readily adsorbed out by PS/A-positive strains of S. epidermidis and recombinant strains of staphylococci carrying the ica genes. We conclude that the ica locus encodes production of PS/A and that the properties of S. epidermidis associated with initial bacterial adherence, biofilm formation, and intercellular adhesion can be correlated with elaboration of PS/A.",

        "A combinatorial library of degradable polyarylates was prepared. These polymers are A-B-type copolymers consisting of an alternating sequence of a diphenol and a diacid. The library was prepared by copolymerizing, in all possible combinations, 14 different tyrosine-derived diphenols and eight different aliphatic diacids, resulting in 8 x 14 = 112 distinct polymers. This approach (a) increases the number of available polymeric candidate materials for medical applications, and (b) facilitates the identification of correlations between polymer structure and glass transition temperature, air-water contact angle, mechanical properties, and fibroblast proliferation. The pendent chain and backbone structures were systematically varied by (a) simple homologative variations in the number of methylene groups, (b) substitution of oxygen for methylene groups, and (c) introduction of branched and aromatic structures. The polymers contained within the library exhibited incremental variations in Tg (from 2 degrees C to 91 degrees C) and air-water contact angle (from 64 degrees to 101 degrees ). Fibroblast proliferation (in vitro, serum-containing media) ranged from approximating that measured on tissue culture polystyrene to complete absence of proliferation. Generally, decreased proliferation correlated linearly with increased surface hydrophobicity, except in those polymers derived from oxygen-containing diacids in their backbone which were uniformly good growth substrates even if their surfaces were very hydrophobic. In a selected subgroup of polymers, tensile strength of thin solvent cast films ranged from about 6 to 45 MPa, while Young's modulus (stiffness) ranged from about 0.3 to 1.7 GPa. Combinatorial biomaterial libraries such as these tyrosine-derived polyarylates permit the systematic study of material-dependent biological responses and provide the medical device designer with the option to choose a suitable material from a library of related polymers that encompasses a broad range of properties.",
        "The Medical Devices Agency (MDA) has investigated potential human health hazards arising from the presence of dithiocarbamate vulcanization accelerators in latex products (mainly gloves). After collection of manufacturer's data on usage and residues of these accelerators, an independent investigation of solvent extractable residues and dithiocarbamate migration into aqueous simulants was commissioned, to complement equivalent \"in-house\" test data from two major manufacturers. The presence of extractable accelerator residues in commercial products was confirmed. Potential human health hazards associated with dithiocarbamates include genotoxicity and possible carcinogenicity: a review of published data was conducted to evaluate the evidence for this, with particular reference to three zinc dithiocarbamates with significant commercial usage (ZDMC, ZDEC and ZDBC: see Fig. 1). Data gaps were identified, and mutagenicity studies commissioned to fill these. These studies comprised tests both in vitro (bacterial and L5178Y cell gene mutation, cultured lymphocyte chromosome aberration) and in vivo (mouse bone marrow micronucleus, rat liver UDS). It is concluded that ZDMC must be considered a genotoxin (and thus a probable carcinogen): residues of this substance in latex medical devices should be minimized. ZDEC proved genotoxic in vitro but was not clearly genotoxic in vivo, and may have activity intermediate between that of ZDMC and that of ZDBC, which showed at most weak activity in a single in vitro (chromosome aberration) test. It is proposed that the use of ZDBC as a vulcanization accelerator in the manufacture of latex gloves, rather than ZDEC, ZDMC or their precursors, would reduce or remove the health concerns arising from accelerator residues.",

        "The Vivostat System is a medical device for the preparation of an autologous fibrin sealant from 120 mL of the patient's blood in the operating room. The system is fully automated and microprocessor controlled and is made up of three components: an automated processor unit, an automated applicator unit, and a disposable, single-patient-use unit, which includes a preparation set and a Spraypen applicator. The biochemical process is initiated by batroxobin, which acts upon the fibrinogen in the patient's plasma. The completion of the process depends entirely on endogenous thrombin in producing the sealant.\nTwenty-four volunteer patients undergoing elective primary coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to either conventional hemostasis (control group) or the use of Vivostat fibrin sealant as an adjunct to conventional hemostasis. The patients were followed up at 1 month and 1 year.\nThe preparation process was completed in 30 minutes. No safety issues associated with the use of the sealant were identified. From 120 mL of the patient's blood the yield of fibrin sealant was 4.5 mL (range, 3.9 to 4.8 mL). There was a favorable trend toward lower amounts of chest tube drainage in the Vivostat group. In the Vivostat group, 1 of 11 patients (9%) required a perioperative transfusion and in the control group 3 of 12 patients (25%) required a perioperative transfusion.\nIt is possible to prepare autologous fibrin sealant with the Vivostat system in 30 minutes. No exogenous thrombin is required. The sealant has no known adverse effects and may prove to be a useful adjunct to hemostasis in cardiothoracic surgery.",

To aid in this decision-making process, managed care companies turn to technology assessment, a process that differs from the Food and Drug Administration's review of medical devices. Health plans typically use a structured approach to implementing coverage requirements in employer group benefits contracts and use technology assessment to evaluate the scientific evidence of effectiveness to support coverage decisions. Also important is the societal context for decisions regarding coverage for new technologies and the options being considered by policy makers for accountability in technology assessment by private insurers and health plans.",

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), an organization within the Food and Drug Administration, has the legal authority and responsibility for ensuring that medical devices marketed in the United States are both reasonably safe and effective for their intended use. This is an enormous challenge given the diversity of medical devices and the large number of different types of devices on the market. Many scientific and regulatory activities are necessary to ensure device safety and effectiveness, including technology assessment, albeit in a manner quite different from that of conventional technology assessment. The basic approach taken at the CDRH to ensure device safety and effectiveness is to develop an understanding of the way in which a medical device works and how it will perform in clinical situations.",
        "Medical devices that are used on patients in fields containing potentially infectious body fluids can become contaminated and transmit infectious agents to other sites on the patient or to other patients if the devices are not properly cleaned and decontaminated after use on each patient treatment site. One such device is the needleless or jet injector, which is widely used in medicine and dentistry to deliver local anesthetic in procedures such as bone marrow aspirations, lumbar punctures, and cutaneous and intraoral injections. This study was conducted to determine whether cross-contamination can occur on in vitro reuse of a needleless injector and whether a manufacturer's recommended method of injector decontamination (ie, immersion sterilization) is effective in the prevention of cross-contamination.\nThe study was performed with new autoclaved injectors, fluorescein dye, and Streptococcus crista (the bacteria commonly found in saliva) in the field of use to determine whether these devices can become contaminated during use and carry over the contamination to other sites during immediate reuse.\nFluorescein dye and bacteria tests with the needleless injectors showed that contamination or carryover does occur. It appeared to reduced to a minimum when a autoclaved, sterile rubber cap used over the head of the device during injection was replaced between each use, although replacement of the rubber cap alone did not prevent carryover. Immersion of the head of the injector in a 2% glutaraldehyde solution for 30 minutes followed by a sterile water rinse and the replacement of the rubber cap with a sterile cap between uses was shown to curtail bacterial growth and prevent cross-contamination on immediate reuse of the device.\nThis study demonstrated that needleless injectors become contaminated during in vitro use and direct contact with contaminated surfaces and that needless injectors carry over the contamination to subsequent sites of release. The replacement of the injector's rubber cap with a new one after initial discharge or the removal of an exposed rubber cap and immersion of the head of the injector in 2% glutaraldehyde followed by a rinse of the head in sterile water, as recommended by one injector manufacturer, can minimize or eliminate the carryover.",
        "Three types of ureteral stents were used in a study of 53 patients. Following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, the stents were implanted and retained for periods of between 3 and 40 days. Each patient received daily antibiotic therapy with either ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim. After removal, the devices were analyzed for adherent bacteria and encrustations. The study showed that a conditioning film became deposited onto the stents upon implantation, changing the surface characteristics of the biomaterials. Dense encrustations were found to be least on a low surface energy device. No differences were found related to patient age and gender or duration of stent insertion. Flakiness and apparent sloughing of the stent surfaces was observed in some devices, raising concerns as to what actually happens to medical devices when exposed to the host urinary tract. Bacteria were recovered from the urine of three patients and the stents of four patients treated with trimethoprim. Five stents had bacterial biofilms detected by SEM. The actual clinical end-point was not the focus of this study, but no patients became septic. Our goal was to demonstrate conclusively in humans that medical devices do develop conditioning films upon implantation, and that they can be susceptible to bacterial colonization even during antibiotic treatments. The kidneys of stented patients are clearly at risk of infection, and only by proper selection of a stent type and appropriate antibiotic coverage can this risk be significantly reduced.",

        "A retrospective review of social insurance claim files of male blue collar workers was conducted to compare the social insurance costs of percutaneous lumbar nucleotomy with standard lumbar discectomy ; 29 percutaneous nucleotomy procedures were matched with 58 standard discectomies all carried out between January 1992 and December 1994. It was concluded that a standard discectomy procedure results in significantly higher costs during hospitalisation with respect to surgery, anaesthesia and hospital stay. A percutaneous nucleotomy leads to a significantly higher outpatient expenditure especially in radiology and medical devices. The relative proportion of outpatient practitioner's visits and hospital stay costs was significantly higher for the standard discectomy whereas medical devices had a relatively higher share in outpatient expenditure for the percutaneous nucleotomy. In this population of 87 compensation claimants, the average social insurance costs did not significantly differ between the percutaneous nucleotomy and the standard discectomy.",

        "The polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) is an important factor in the colonization of medical devices by Staphylococcus epidermidis. The genes encoding PIA production are organized in the icaADBC (intercellular adhesion) operon. To study the function of the individual genes, we have established an in vitro assay with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, the substrate for PIA biosynthesis, and analyzed the products by thin-layer chromatography and mass spectrometry. IcaA alone exhibited a low N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity and represents the catalytic enzyme. Coexpression of icaA with icaD led to a significant increase in activity. The newly identified icaD gene is located between icaA and icaB and overlaps both genes. N-Acetylglucosamine oligomers produced by IcaAD reached a maximal length of 20 residues. Only when icaA and icaD were expressed together with icaC were oligomer chains that react with PIA-specific antiserum synthesized. IcaA and IcaD are located in the cytoplasmic membrane, and IcaC also has all the structural features of an integral membrane protein. These results indicate a close interaction between IcaA, IcaD, and IcaC. Tunicamycin and bacitracin did not affect the in vitro synthesis of PIA intermediates or the complete PIA biosynthesis in vivo, suggesting that a undecaprenyl phosphate carrier is not involved.

        "Birth asphyxia represents a serious problem worldwide, resulting in approximately 1 million deaths and an equal number of serious sequelae annually. It is therefore important to develop new and better ways to treat asphyxia. Resuscitation after birth asphyxia traditionally has been carried out with 100% oxygen, and most guidelines and textbooks recommend this; however, the scientific background for this has never been established. On the contrary, theoretic considerations indicate that resuscitation with high oxygen concentrations could have detrimental effects. We have performed a series of animal studies as well as one pilot study indicating that resuscitation can be performed with room air just as efficiently as with 100% oxygen. To test this more thoroughly, we organized a multicenter study and hypothesized that room air is superior to 100% oxygen when asphyxiated newborn infants are resuscitated.\nIn a prospective, international, controlled multicenter study including 11 centers from six countries, asphyxiated newborn infants with birth weight >999 g were allocated to resuscitation with either room air or 100% oxygen. The study was not blinded, and the patients were allocated to one of the two treatment groups according to date of birth. Those born on even dates were resuscitated with room air and those born on odd dates with 100% oxygen. Informed consent was not obtained until after the initial resuscitation, an arrangement in agreement with the new proposal of the US Food and Drug Administration's rules governing investigational drugs and medical devices to permit clinical research on emergency care without the consent of subjects. The protocol was approved by the ethical committees at each participating center. Entry criterion was apnea or gasping with heart rate <80 beats per minute at birth necessitating resuscitation. Exclusion criteria were birth weight <1000 g, lethal anomalies, hydrops, cyanotic congenital heart defects, and stillbirths. Primary outcome measures were death within 1 week and/or presence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, grade II or III, according to a modification of Sarnat and Sarnat. Secondary outcome measures were Apgar score at 5 minutes, heart rate at 90 seconds, time to first breath, time to first cry, duration of resuscitation, arterial blood gases and acid base status at 10 and 30 minutes of age, and abnormal neurologic examination at 4 weeks. The existing routines for resuscitation in each participating unit were followed, and the ventilation techniques described by the American Heart Association were used as guidelines aiming at a frequency of manual ventilation of 40 to 60 breaths per minute.\nForms for 703 enrolled infants from 11 centers were received by the steering committee. All 94 patients from one of the centers were excluded because of violation of the inclusion criteria in 86 of these. Therefore, the final number of infants enrolled in the study was 609 (from 10 centers), with 288 in the room air group and 321 in the oxygen group. Median (5 to 95 percentile) gestational ages were 38 (32.0 to 42.0) and 38 (31.1 to 41.5) weeks (NS), and birth weights were 2600 (1320 to 4078) g and 2560 (1303 to 3900) g (NS) in the room air and oxygen groups, respectively. There were 46% girls in the room air and 41% in the oxygen group (NS). Mortality in the first 7 days of life was 12.2% and 15.0% in the room air and oxygen groups, respectively; adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.82 with 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.50-1.35. Neonatal mortality was 13.9% and 19.0%; adjusted OR = 0. 72 with 95% CI = 0.45-1.15. Death within 7 days of life and/or moderate or severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (primary outcome measure) was seen in 21.2% in the room air group and in 23.7% in the oxygen group; OR = 0.94 with 95% CI = 0.63-1.40.

        "A selenium based digital x-ray system dedicated to chest radiography has been installed by the UK Department of Health's Medical Devices Agency at Leeds General Infirmary, UK, to undergo a comprehensive evaluation, including the physical image quality. The underlying characteristics which define the overall image quality of a system are the following: sensitometric response, modulation transfer function, and noise power spectrum. These have been measured objectively on preprocessed digital data acquired under relevant radiographic conditions. The image data is further processed prior to hard copy display. The displayed image quality may only be measured subjectively; threshold contrast detail detectability is such a measure which can be related to the objective measures of image quality. The objective imaging characteristics suggest that Thoravision has a significant advantage over conventional radiography imaging systems. However, subjective measures have demonstrated that the image processing can have a significant effect on the perceived image quality. Thoravision has the potential to deliver a significantly improved image quality to clinicians with no increase in radiation exposure to the patient, or image quality may be maintained with a reduction in radiation exposure. Digital image processing is central to the efficiency with which it achieves this.",

        "In this review, controlled clinical trials of acupuncture are placed into five categories on the basis of the treatment with which acupuncture is compared. Methodological and ethical issues relevant to each category are discussed. Wait list (or no treatment) controls, which are ethically acceptable for stable, chronic conditions, assess the efficacy of acupuncture relative to the natural history of the condition but do not control for nonspecific treatment effects. Placebo controls, defined here as noninvasive procedures such as inactive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or mock needling, assess whether acupuncture has an effect beyond that of the therapeutic milieu. Sham controls, defined as invasive but inappropriate procedures such as shallow needling at nonacupoint sites, assess whether acupuncture efficacy depends on the style and location of needling. Standard care comparisons assess whether acupuncture performs at least as well as a medication, medical device, or physiotherapy. Adjunctive care comparisons assess the efficacy of acupuncture plus standard care relative to standard care alone. From an ethical perspective, active debate surrounds placebo and sham controls. Those who argue against these procedures consider withholding treatment to be improper. They favor the wait list and both standard care designs in which all patients receive treatment. Others argue that testing a treatment prior to demonstrating its efficacy against a placebo is equally improper. From a methodological perspective, it should also be considered that most clinical trials of acupuncture have assessed its efficacy by administering a fixed course of treatment based on biomedical diagnosis. The challenge for future trials is to design conditions that more closely mimic the delivery of acupuncture in clinical practice, as individualized treatment informed by its own diagnostic traditions.",
        "Antimicrobial coating of medical devices, including fracture fixation devices, has evolved as a potentially effective method for preventing device-related infections. We examined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of titanium cylinders coated with the antiseptic combination of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol. The coated devices provided zones of inhibition against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans, at baseline and up to 8 weeks after incubation of the coated cylinders in human serum at 37 degrees C. This durable antimicrobial activity was attributed to the relatively slow leaching of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol from the coated cylinders as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. These results suggest that antiseptic-coated orthopaedic devices may provide broad-spectrum and durable antimicrobial protection against device-related infection.",

The health care facility is concerned with maintaining the safety of patients and staff, enhancing the cost efficiency of its operations, and controlling liability. Human factors engineering can be effective in realizing all of these goals. Proactive measures include (1) evaluation of currently employed systems for efficiency and error potential, (2) evaluation of systems prior to purchase, (3) evaluation and enhancement of facilities, and (4) design and evaluation of procedures. Retroactively, HFE participation in accident/incident investigations can carry such investigations beyond the placing of blame to determining what made a human error possible or even inevitable.",
        "\"The FDA has long advocated the use of standards as a significant contributor to safety and effectiveness of medical devices,\" Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH) Donald E. Marlowe and Philip J. Phillips note in the following article, highlighting the latest U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans for use of standards. They note that the important role standards can play has been reinforced as part of FDA reengineering efforts undertaken in anticipation of an increased regulatory work-load and declining agency resources. As part of its restructuring effort, the FDA announced last spring that it would recognize some consensus standards for use in the device approval process. Under the new 510(k) paradigm--the FDA's proposal to streamline premarket review, which includes incorporating the use of standards in the review of 510(k) submissions--the FDA will accept proof of compliance with standards as evidence of device safety and effectiveness. Manufacturers may submit declarations of conformity to standards instead of following the traditional review process. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60601 series of consensus standards, which deals with many safety issues common to electrical medical devices, was the first to be chosen for regulatory review. Other standards developed by nationally or internationally recognized standards development organizations, such as AAMI, may be eligible for use to ensure review requirements. In the following article, Marlowe and Phillips describe the FDA's plans to use standards in the device review process. The article focuses on the use of standards for medical device review, the development of the standards recognition process for reviewing devices, and the anticipated benefits of using standards to review devices. One important development has been the recent implementation of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA), which advocates the use of standards in the device review process. In implementing the legislation, the FDA published in the Federal Register a list of standards to which manufacturers may declare conformity. Visit AAMI's Web site at www.aami.org/news/fda.standards for a copy of the list and for information on nominating other standards for official recognition by the agency. The FDA expects that use of standards will benefit the agency and manufacturers alike: \"We estimate that in time, reliance on declarations of conformity to recognized standards could save the agency considerable resources while reducing the regulatory obstacles to entry to domestic and international markets,\" state the authors.",

        "The past few years have seen increased reports that medical devices, such as pacemakers, apnea monitors, electrically powered wheelchairs, etc., have failed to operate correctly because of interference from various emitters of radiofrequency energy. This condition is called radiofrequency interference (RFI). The consequences of these failures range from inconvenience to serious injuries and death. Reasons for this problem are twofold: 1) increasing numbers of electronically controlled medical devices with inadequate electronic protection against RFI, and 2) a significant increase in the number of RF sources in the environment. Medical devices are widely used outside the hospital and may be attached to, or implanted in, patients. Portable wireless communications equipment, including cellular phones, handheld transceivers, and vehicle-mounted transceivers, comprise one of the largest sources of RFI. Some medical devices are especially sensitive to the type of digital modulation that some of the wireless communications devices utilize. The prevailing international standard for the RF immunity of medical devices is the 1993 revision of the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) Standard IEC 60601-1-2. This standard sets a minimum immunity level of 3 volts per meter (V/m) in the 26-1000 MHz frequency range. For non-life supporting devices, testing is required only at the specific frequencies of 27.12, 40.68, and 915 MHz. Technology exists to protect, or \"harden,\" most medical devices from RF fields that are much more intense than the 3 V/m level specified in present RFI standards. Most of these techniques, including shielding, grounding, and filtering, are not costly if they are incorporated into the initial design of the electronics system. COMAR recommends that the various parties involved in the manufacture and use of RFI-prone medical devices take steps to avoid serious RFI problems that may lead to safety hazards. Medical device manufacturers should design and test their products to ensure conformance with current RFI standards and educate the users of their devices about the possible symptoms of potential RFI. If there exists the possibility of RFI problems to medical devices, steps should be taken to ensure that all sources of RF energy be kept at a sufficient distance.",

        "During the past 2-3 decades, development work on Medical Devices focused on improving their functionality (device control, signal analysis, pattern recognition and classification). At present, the dominant user requirement is information integration. This requires interconnectivity and interoperability of devices and device systems. Today, due to all major manufacturers operating globally, this requirement can only be met if standards with global relevance are developed. The first standard discussed is the Standard Communications Protocol for Computerized Electrocardiography (SCP ECG). The rapid finalization of the standards document itself was possible due to some of the experts being involved on basic problems for greater than 10 years. Their knowledge and long standing cooperation contributed significantly to a fast consensus finding process as well as quick implementation. The second standard discussed in this paper deals with Vital Signs Information Representation. Before starting to write the document, an International inventory workshop was held to document the state of the technology and of user requirements. This common base of problem understanding makes consensus finding less difficult. Continuous cooperation between the IEEE P1073 group and the CEN/TC251 WG5 project team also ensures early harmonization of the related standards. Finally, early implementation projects in Europe and the US allow verification and modifications based on feed-back from practical experience.",
        "The Medical Information Bus (MIB) is a data communications standard for bedside patient connected medical devices. It is formally titled IEEE 1073 Standard for Medical Device Communications. MIB defines a complete seven layer communications stack for devices in acute care settings. All of the design trade-offs in writing the standard were taken to optimize performance in acute care settings. The key clinician based constraints on network performance are: (1) the network must be able to withstand multiple daily reconfigurations due to patient movement and condition changes; (2) the network must be 'plug-and-play' to allow clinicians to set up the network by simply plugging in a connector, taking no other actions; (3) the network must allow for unambiguous associations of devices with specific patients. A network of this type will be used by clinicians, thus giving complete, accurate, real time data from patient connected devices. This capability leads to many possible improvements in patient care and hospital cost reduction. The possible uses for comprehensive automatic data capture are only limited by imagination and creativity of clinicians adapting to the new hospital business paradigm.",
        "Previously, Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from the blood of hospitalized patients were often considered contaminants. Now, coagulase-negative staphylococci are among the leading causes of nosocomial blood infections. Multidrug resistance could predict a true nosocomial infection rather than a blood culture contaminant. Recent studies indicated the emergence of resistance to the quinolones, particularly to ciprofloxacin. Tolerance and occasional resistance to vancomycin have been reported recently. In addition, several reports indicated that vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics lose their effectiveness against S. epidermidis organisms embedded in the biofilm environment on the surface of medical devices. Alternative agents have been proposed in the prevention and treatment of device-related and glycopeptide-tolerant S. epidermidis infections. These agents include minocycline, rifampin, and, more recently, quinupristin/dalfopristin and the oxazolidinones.",
        "People who choose not to abstain from sexual intercourse can use barrier contraceptive methods, such as condoms, to reduce their risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  Health care providers who provide safer sex education and counseling should provide information on condoms as a way of reducing the risk of HIV/STD transmission.  Since latex condoms are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as medical devices, FDA regulations govern latex condom manufacturing and testing in accordance with stringent national standards.  The FDA randomly tests imported condoms according to the same stringent quality control standards as US-produced condoms.  Condom effectiveness, however, depends upon their correct and consistent use during every sexual act.  Relevant data and guidelines are presented on the correct use of male latex and female polyurethane condoms.  Both male latex and female polyurethane condoms can prevent the transmission of HIV and other STDs.",
        "The international use of medical device standards is expanding for both economic and regulatory reasons. It is no longer adequate to have standards that only specify measurement methods and labeling for a product. An effort needs to be put forth between industry, academia and government to promote standards that also include a minimum set of acceptable performance criteria. This will allow for a less subjective evaluation of the conformance of the medical device to the appropriate standard as well as promote a uniform set of minimal performance expectations for a class of products among consumers.",
        "Telemedicine is defined as the \"delivery of health care and sharing of medical knowledge over a distance using telecommunication systems.\" The concept of telemedicine is not new. Beyond the use of the telephone, there were numerous attempts to develop telemedicine programs in the 1960s mostly based on interactive television. The early experience was conceptionally encouraging but suffered inadequate technology. With a few notable exceptions such as the telemetry of medical data in the space program, there was very little advancement of telemedicine in the 1970s and 1980s. Interest in telemedicine has exploded in the 1990s with the development of medical devices suited to capturing images and other data in digital electronic form and the development and installation of high speed, high bandwidth telecommunication systems around the world. Clinical applications of telemedicine are now found in virtually every specialty. Teleradiology is the most common application followed by cardiology, dermatology, psychiatry, emergency medicine, home health care, pathology, and oncology. The technological basis and the practical issues are highly variable from one clinical application to another. Teleradiology, including telenuclear medicine, is one of the more well-defined telemedicine services. Techniques have been developed for the acquisition and digitization of images, image compression, image transmission, and image interpretation. The American College of Radiology has promulgated standards for teleradiology, including the requirement for the use of high resolution 2000 x 2000 pixel workstations for the interpretation of plain films. Other elements of the standard address image annotation, patient confidentiality, workstation functionality, cathode ray tube brightness, and image compression. Teleradiology systems are now widely deployed in clinical practice. Applications include providing service from larger to smaller institutions, coverage of outpatient clinics, imaging centers, and nursing homes. Teleradiology is also being used in international applications. Unresolved issues in telemedicine include licensure, the development of standards, reimbursement for services, patient confidentiality, and telecommunications infrastructure and cost. A number of states and medical boards have instituted policies and regulations to prevent physicians who are not licensed in the respective state to provide telemedicine services. This is a major impediment to the delivery of telemedicine between states. Telemedicine, including teleradiology, is here to stay and is changing the practice of medicine dramatically. National and international communications networks are being created that enable the sharing of information and knowledge at a distance. Technological barriers are being overcome leaving organizational, legal, financial, and special interest issues as the major impediments to the further development of telemedicine and realization of its benefits.",

Literature on specific technological devices and articles that contained the terms self-removal, withdrawal, devices, self-extubation, unplanned extubation, and involuntary treatment were searched.\nLiterature on treatment interference was found in four main topic areas: (1) maintaining treatment, (2) unplanned extubation, (3) disruption or manipulation of a medical device, and (4) involuntary treatment.\nThe results clearly establish the clinical importance of treatment interference and underscore the multidisciplinary and multifactorial nature of this perplexing, life-threatening clinical problem. Future research on treatment interference should emphasize systematically building an understanding of the processes involved, including patients' attributes, behavioral cues, and consequences, to develop appropriate multidisciplinary strategies to prevent patients' self-removal of technological devices.",
        "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule to classify/reclassify immunohistochemistry reagents and kits (IHC's) into three classes depending on intended use. FDA is classifying/reclassifying into class I (general controls) and exempt from premarket notification requirements IHC's used as adjunctive tests and presenting a low risk to public health. FDA is classifying/reclassifying into class II (special control) IHC's that detect or measure certain target analytes and that provide prognostic or predictive data that is not confirmed by routine histopathologic control specimens. The results of the class II IHC's are reported independently to the clinician, and the performance claims are widely accepted and supported by valid scientific evidence. FDA is classifying/reclassifying into class III (premarket approval) IHC's intended for any other use. The scope of products covered by this final rule includes both pre-1976 devices that have not been previously classified, as well as post-1976 devices that are statutorily classified into class III. The intent of this final rule is to regulate pre-1976 devices and post-1976 devices in a consistent fashion. Therefore, FDA is classifying or reclassifying these products as applicable.",
        "A 1995 resolution of the American Medical Association House of Delegates, introduced by the American Academy of Neurology, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons, asked the American Medical Association Council on Scientific Affairs to add the use of hardened silicone shunts to its study of the effects of silicone gel used in breast implants. On consideration of the important differences between the two materials, silicone elastomer (\"hardened silicone\") and silicone gel, the Council on Scientific Affairs elected to address the subject of silicone elastomer shunt systems separately. This report describes the different types of medical-grade silicone used in medical devices, the incidence of hydrocephalus and its causes and treatment, and the use of cerebrospinal fluid shunt systems made of silicone elastomer. Published case reports of possible immunological disease in patients who have had silicone elastomer cerebrospinal fluid shunt systems implanted are reviewed. The Council on Scientific Affairs concluded that the evidence presented does not support the occurrence of immune-mediated systemic reactions to implanted silicone elastomer cerebrospinal fluid shunt systems. The local granulomatous or inflammatory responses observed in some patients with silicone shunt systems have not been shown to be immunologically mediated; similar reactions have been described with other implanted foreign bodies.",

        "New materials and coatings are now being developed to resist permanent bacterial contamination of implanted medical devices. This study exposed several styles of middle ear ventilation tube materials and coatings to high concentrations of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus. Electron microscopy was then used to evaluate these tubes' resistance to bacterial biofilm formations. Ionized, processed silicone tubes were the only tubes resistant to Pseudomonas adhesion. Tubes that were made of fluoroplastic or that were ionized processed were very resistant to Staphylococcus contamination when compared with untreated silicone or silver oxide-treated silicone. This study suggests that ionized, coated fluoroplastic would be a highly effective tube material in preventing bacterial biofilm contamination of implanted ventilation tubes.",

        "Staphylococcus epidermidis is the preeminent cause of nosocomial bacteraemia and infection of prosthetic medical devices. Bacterial adherence to biomaterial is a crucial early event in the pathogenesis of these infections. Antibiotics affect bacterial adherence to eukaryotic cells, capsule formation and biofilm production. However, results from studies involving coagulase-negative staphylococci are equivocal. In this study, the in-vitro adherence of radiolabelled bacteria was assayed to determine the effect of sublethal concentrations of a number of antibiotics on the attachment of four strains of S. epidermidis, with well-characterized adherence profiles, to intravascular catheters. The effect of antibiotics on biofilm production by S. epidermidis was assayed using a quantitative spectrophotometric assay. Although there was some strain-to-strain variability, none of the tested antibiotics affected bacterial attachment. However, treatment with cefazolin or vancomycin resulted in a significant decrease in biofilm elaboration. These data suggest that bacterial attachment by S. epidermidis, the initiating event associated with prosthetic device infection, cannot be prevented by subtherapeutic levels of fluoroquinolone, glycopeptide or beta-lactam antibiotics. However, later aggregative stages of adherence, associated with biofilm production, may be influenced by cell wall-active agents such as cefazolin and vancomycin.",

Investigations revealed the presence of the organism in spatulae from all ward areas investigated and from closed boxed containers held in the central hospital stores obtained from a new supplier. In contrast, culture of spatulae from the initial supplier failed to yield any fungal isolates. The incident was reported to the Medical Device Agency (MDA), the Central Public Health Laboratory Service (CPHLS) and the Birmingham PHLS. A statement was prepared for the weekly Communicable Disease Report and a hazard warning issued by the MDA. The spatulae were withdrawn from use and the contract with the original supplier was re-established. This incident resulted in contamination of samples only and no patient involvement. It highlights the problems which may follow use of equipment for unintended purposes and the need for good manufacturing practice guidelines to be applied to non-sterile equipment used in direct patient care.",
        "A brief overview is provided of some of the general safety and risk assessment procedures used by the different centers of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) to evaluate low-level exposures. The U.S. FDA protects public health by regulating a wide variety of consumer products including foods, human and animal drugs, biologics, and medical devices under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The diverse legal and regulatory standards in the act allow for the consideration of benefits for some products (e.g., drugs) but preclude them from others (e.g., food additives). When not precluded by statutory mandates (e.g., Delaney prohibition), the U.S. FDA considers both physiologic adaptive responses and beneficial effects. For the basic safety assessment paradigm as presently used, for example in the premarket approval of food additives, the emphasis is on the identification of adverse effects and no observed adverse effect level(s) (NOAEL). Generally, the NOAEL is divided by safety factors to establish an acceptable exposure level. This safety assessment paradigm does not preclude the consideration of effects whether they are biologically adaptive or beneficial at lower dose levels. The flexibility to consider issues such as mechanisms of action and adaptive and beneficial responses depends on the product under consideration. For carcinogenic contaminants and radiation from medical devices, the U.S. FDA considers the potential cancer risk at low exposure levels. This generally involves downward extrapolation from the observed dose-response range. The consideration of adverse effects of other toxicologic end points (e.g., reproductive, immunologic, neurologic, developmental) associated with low exposure levels is also becoming more of a reality (e.g., endocrine disrupters). The evaluation of the biologic effects of low-level exposures to toxic substances must include whether the effect is adverse or a normal physiologic adaptive response and also determine the resiliency of a physiologic system. The public health mandate of the U.S. FDA includes an active research program at the National Center for Toxicological Research and the other U.S. FDA centers to support the regulatory mission of the U.S. FDA. This includes the development of knowledge bases, predictive strategies, and toxicologic studies to investigate effects at the lower end of the dose-response range. Because of the wide diversity of legal and regulatory standards for various products regulated by the U.S. FDA agency-wide safety and risk assessment procedures and policies generally do not exist.",
        "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is an independent regulatory agency that was created in 1973. The CPSC has jurisdiction over more the 15,000 types of consumer products used in and around the home or by children, except items such as food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, pesticides, certain radioactive materials, products that emit radiation (e.g., microwave ovens), and automobiles. The CPSC has investigated many low-level exposures from consumer products, including formaldehyde emissions from urea-formaldehyde foam insulation and pressed wood products, CO and NO2 emmissions from combustion appliances, and dioxin in paper products. Many chemical hazards are addressed under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), which applies to acute and chronic health effects resulting from high- or low-level exposures. In 1992 the Commission issued guidelines for assessing chronic hazards under the FHSA, including carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, reproductive/developmental toxicity, exposure, bioavailability, risk assessment, and acceptable risk. The chronic hazard guidelines describe a series of default assumptions, which are used in the absence of evidence to the contrary. However, the guidelines are intended to be sufficiently flexible to incorporate the latest scientific information. The use of alternative procedures is permissible, on a case-by-case basis, provided that the procedures used are scientifically defensible and supported by appropriate data. The application of the chronic hazard guidelines in assessing the risks from low-level exposures is discussed.",
        "Human drugs and medical devices have to be approved by the health authorities before they can enter the market. For medical software this is not needed. The main argument to resist all attempts to regulate medical software has been that it is impossible to guarantee that software is error-free. This is true of all software. However, in medical software the correctness of medical knowledge is at least as important as the correctness of the code itself. The medical contents of the software could usually be evaluated but the end-users do not have the time or possibilities to do so. The Internet makes it possible to provide commercial services designed by non-professionals. For health care, there are already several commercial services on the net. Since there is no quality assurance or regulation of medical software anyone can sell medical software on the net. Even if physicians were cautious enough not to use untested software, there is a possibility that patients do. In Finland, where over 10% of the population is using the Internet at least weekly, the problem is real. It is impossible to remove poor services from the net and therefore, it is essential to guide the users to use high quality services.

        "Dental amalgam--a mixture of elemental mercury and a silver-dominated metal alloy--has been the most widely used dental filling material for well over a century. Alternative materials exist but are not well suited for some important applications, and all are more expensive than amalgam. The toxic effects of occupational mercury exposure have long been known, but it was not until about 1980 that serious consideration was given to the possibility that mercury vapor escaping from amalgam fillings might be affecting health, specifically producing subtle effects on the central nervous system. Such effects have been reported among dentists and other dental personnel, whose exposures are well below industrial levels but above those from fillings alone. No large studies have been completed that examine the effects of mercury exposure from dental amalgam fillings. In the face of inadequate evidence on the possible risks of dental amalgam, countries have reacted desperately. Sweden is phasing out amalgam entirely, possibly by the end of 1997. Germany has produced guidelines for limiting its use, other countries have signaled their intention to reduce it, and others--the United States and Canada--have studied the matter but taken no action. Policy differences within Europe have made dental amalgam a test case for the European Community's new medical device regulations. Relatively little epidemiologic research has been initiated to try to answer the question of dental amalgam's possible health effects. An international effort to define and carry out a research agenda to guide public policy is called for.",

        "The new European system for the regulation of medical devices is currently being introduced incrementally, having begun in 1993 with a view to completion around the turn of the century. Although still it its relative infancy there has already been valuable experience gained in relation to certain device types. The system is based upon three EC Directives; the first covering active implantable devices is now fully in force; with the second covering most other devices, currently within a transition phase. The Directives fully recognise the importance of stringent post market surveillance, one key element of which involves the reporting of certain device related incidents to and between the regulatory authorities of Member States (Competent Authorities). The objective behind the reporting requirements, or \"Vigilance System\", is to protect patients and other users by reducing the chance of the same types of incidents reoccurring in different places across the European Economic Area (EEA). As Competent Authority for the UK, the Medical Devices Agency was one of the first to put the System into effect and continues to play a leading role. In broad terms, Vigilance requires manufacturers to notify Competent Authorities of incidents, known as Vigilance Cases, in which a device led to or might have led to the death or serious injury of patients or users. In addition they must also provide similar notification of device recalls undertaken for a technical or medical reason. For their part, Competent Authorities are required to share certain details of Vigilance Cases between each other, and with the European Commission. While mandatory incident reporting is not a new concept outside Europe, Vigilance is unique in attempting to coordinate this across nineteen different countries with different languages and cultures. Even after four years, there remains some confusion among industry and regulators alike over exactly what is required and how best to achieve it. In particular there is an element of concern among manufacturers over apparent variations in interpretation being demonstrated by different Competent Authorities. Although derived from an inherently sensible and straight forward objective, in practice Vigilance raises a myriad of questions such as when, how and to whom should reports be made, and perhaps most fundamentally, exactly which incidents should be reported. The Directives themselves offer little clarification, and in recognition of this the Commission drew up the EC Guidelines on the Medical Devices Vigilance System. These Guidelines, while not legally binding offer practical and invaluable answers to these and many other important questions. Ongoing improvements to the Guidelines appear to be the best way to try to \"level the playing field\" across the EEA. Considerable effort continues to be made to fine tune this document with input representing regulatory and industry interests and it is hoped that a second revision may be available next year. Vigilance is gaining popularity as a model for adoption outside the EEA, particularly as it begins to overcome the operational hurdles characteristic of the first \"live running\" of any new system.",
        "A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study of ADCON-L Anti-Adhesion Barrier Gel (a medical device by Gliatech Inc, Cleveland, OH) was conducted in 298 patients undergoing first-time lumbar discectomy to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ADCON-L in preventing postoperative peridural fibrosis and in improving patient clinical outcome. After lumbar discectomy, patients were randomized to receive either ADCON-L gel or nothing (control group) at the conclusion of the surgical procedure. Six months after surgery, peridural scar was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, and postoperative pain and straight-leg-raise angle were assessed. No statistically significant differences between the ADCON-L and control groups were observed in terms of adverse events or wound healing characteristics. ADCON-L gel was shown to be safe and to significantly inhibit peridural scar compared with the control group (P = 0.002). That peridural scarring was reduced with ADCON-L gel was further supported by direct visualization of scar tissue at reoperation in both groups. ADCON-L-treated patients had better clinical outcomes than did control patients. The incidence of activity-related pain was significantly reduced (P = 0.013), straight-leg-raise examination scores were significantly improved (P = 0.024 on the operative side and P = 0.015 on the nonoperative side), and ADCON-L reduced low back pain when it was most severe (P = 0.047) and at the end of the day (P = 0.044).",

        "The Medical Devices Agency of the UK Department of Health continues to receive and investigate reports of incidents that arise from the use of infusion devices. In 1996, the Medical Devices Agency received some 4300 reports of incidents, over 400 of which were classified as infusion-, transfusion-, or dialysis-related. There is, however, a trend towards more active management of medical devices focusing on aspects such as purchasing, training, clinical use, and maintenance, and clearly, nursing staff have an important role in developing such policies. Also, nurses with the responsibility for setting up and overseeing infusions should be aware of some of the problems that can arise during routine use, as an awareness of potential hazards allows users to manage the risks more effectively. This article examines some of the risks associated with the use of infusion devices; in particular, problems that arise while loading the administration set or syringe into the pump, the risks of fluid free flow and syringe siphoning, and the risks from air embolism, flow rate accuracy and infusion pump pressure.",
        "Sulfonated poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-SO3)-grafted polyurethane (PU) copolymer (PU-PEO-SO3) was developed for utilization as a material for biomedical applications. Its bulk properties and biocompatibility were investigated and the results were compared to those of PU and PU-PEO (not sulfonated). PU-PEO-SO3 copolymer showed higher water uptake than PU and PU-PEO, indicative of increased hydrophilicity due to the grafting of PEO-SO3. Compared with PU, PU-PEO-SO3 displayed lower glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting endotherm from DSC analysis, suggesting the increase of microphase separation and the suppression of hard-segment packing. PU-PEO-SO3 had practically similar mechanical properties to PU, indicating that the chemical modification of PU was accomplished without reducing its bulk properties. From the results of biocompatibility tests, PU-PEO-SO3 copolymer showed significantly lower adhesion of platelets and S. epidermidis than PU control and PU-PEO. In addition, the platelet factor 4 (PF4) released from platelets was the lowest in PU-PEO-SO3 among the test materials. PU-PEO-SO3 copolymer, which has excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility, is expected to be useful as coating, molding, and blending materials for artificial organs and medical devices.",

        "Nasolacrimal duct intubation with Silastic tubes often is used for the treatment of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. The more established intubation technique uses tubing designed for bicanalicular intubation. A commercial product now is available for monocanalicular intubation (Monoka tube, FCI, Issy-Les-Moulineaux Cedex, France), made possible by a punctal anchor attached to the proximal end of the tubing. The authors evaluated the complications and results of their experience with Silastic tube monocanalicular intubation for treatment of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.\nThe study design was a retrospectively reviewed clinical trial with the results compared to a historic cohort treated with an alternative medical device.\nThirty-nine pediatric patients with 48 obstructed congenital nasolacrimal ducts were available for treatment and postoperative follow-up. The historic cohort included 25 cases of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.\nThe participants were treated with monocanalicular Silastic tube intubation. The historic cohort was treated with bicanalicular Silastic tube intubation. The tubes were left in place for 4 to 6 months before planned removal.\nDye disappearance tests were performed before and after surgery after removal of the tube. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were noted.\nSignificant complications of the monocanalicular tubing included 1 case of bilateral preseptal cellulitis, 1 case of migration of the punctal anchor into the canaliculus that required surgical correction, 2 cases of a corneal abrasion, 1 case of a corneal ulcer, and 21 cases of premature removal of the tube. Of the 21 cases with premature tube removal, 13 (62%) of the eyes showed an improvement in the symptoms and results of dye disappearance test. Of the 27 cases that completed the full course of tube placement, all the tubes were removed successfully in an office setting, and 25 (93%) showed an improvement in the symptoms and results of dye disappearance test. Significant complications of the authors' bicanalicular intubation include stretching of the punctum, tube dislodgement, and tube removal requiring general anesthesia to the patient. Of the authors' 25 cases treated with bicanalicular intubation, 17 (68%) showed an improvement in the symptoms and results of dye disappearance test.\nThe recently introduced Silastic monocanalicular tubing offers an alternative to bicanalicular tubing for treatment with intubation of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Complications due to intubation persist with the monocanalicular tube. However, some of the complications the authors encountered may be avoided by a recent change in the design of the tubing and by familiarity with recommended techniques. The overall success rate of 79% with the Monoka tube is lower than that for published reports of bicanalicular intubation.",
        "In passing blood through an artificial circulatory system, the blood is exposed to surfaces that result in activation of the complement system. The consequences of the activation of complement can be extremely serious for the patient ranging from mild discomfort to respiratory distress and even anaphylaxis. An entirely novel approach was to express recombinant GPI anchored human decay accelerating factor (hDAF) using the baculovirus system and then coat the recombinant protein onto the surfaces of these materials to reduce complement activation. Expression of hDAF in Sf9 cells was shown by ELISA, FACS analysis, and Western blot. Functional activity was tested by CH50 assay. For the coating experiments a small scale model of a cardiovascular bypass circuit constructed from COBE tubing was used. hDAF was either coated onto the circuit using adsorption or covalently linked via the photoreactive crosslinker, p-azidobenzoyl hydrazide. After coating, heparinised human blood was pumped around the circuit and samples were collected into EDTA collection tubes at different time points. Complement activation was measured using a Quidel C3a-des-arg EIA. The photolinked circuits gave a reduction in C3a production of 20-50%, compared to 10-20% seen with an absorbed hDAF circuit. Furthermore, the inhibition of complement was seen over the whole time scale of the photolinked circuit, 60-90 min, whilst in the adsorbed circuit inhibition was not seen to a significant degree after 60 min. The time scale of a standard cardiac bypass is 45-90 min, therefore, the photolinked circuit results are encouraging, as significant inhibition of complement activation is seen within this time frame.",

        "The last issue of BI&T explored the nature and role of human factors engineering (HFE) in health care. That column examined how the \"root cause\" of an accident is often simply labeled \"human error\" and how human error can be a convenient way to explain away a system-wide problem. HFE is highly effective in designing and operating systems that consider human strengths and weaknesses and do not \"set up\" users to commit errors. Still, people will continue to commit errors, no matter how hard we try. Yet we can design systems that, if not \"fail-safe\", are at least \"fault tolerant.\" In these systems errors are more difficult to commit and are more easily detected, corrected, and mitigated. Human factors engineering can be of value to the health care industry in at least three highly critical areas: Developing new systems to enhance safety, efficiency, and usability; Evaluating whether to purchase particular equipment and how to effectively integrate it into hospital systems; and Investigating accidents. This article will review the HFE analysis and design activities undertaken in developing a new system. The article in the next issue of BI&T will explore HFE developmental and usability and evaluation activities.",

This method tests hormone levels in urine to enable women to avoid unprotected intercourse during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle.  A pre-marketing clinical trial conducted by Upipath, the manufacturer of Persona, claimed a 94% reliability rate.  However, the Medical Devices Agency has been unable to substantiate this claim and received numerous complaints from users, general practitioners, and trading standards officers.  The warning letter advises physicians that, although Persona is basically a test-based form of the rhythm method, its technological basis may raise user expectations of accuracy.  The letter notes that users should be aware a 94% reliability may also be expressed as a risk of 1 in 17 users becoming pregnant per 12 months of use.  Persona is not considered suitable for women whose menstrual cycles do not fall into the 23-35 day range, those who have recently given birth or are breast feeding, and users of hormonal contraception.",
        "Plasma protein adsorption patterns on colloidal drug carriers acquired after i.v. administration depend on their surface characteristics and are regarded as key factors for their in vivo organ distribution. Polymeric latex particles with strongly differing surface properties were synthesized as models for colloidal drug carriers for tissue-specific drug targeting via the intravenous route. Physicochemical characterization was performed for size, surface charge density, zeta potential, and surface hydrophobicity. The interactions with human plasma proteins were studied by way of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE). Considerable differences in protein adsorption on the latex particles were detected with regard to the total amount of surface-bound protein on the various particle types as well as specific proteins adsorbed, for example, fibrinogen, albumin, and a recently identified plasma glycoprotein. Possible correlations between protein adsorption patterns and the physicochemical characteristics and topography of the polymeric surfaces are shown and discussed. Knowledge about protein-nanoparticle interactions can be utilized for the rational design of colloidal drug carriers and also may be useful for optimizing implants and medical devices.",

        "We investigated the cytotoxicity of different dental materials according to the study protocol adopted by our lab for the screening of new materials. Experimental parameters used in such testing are addressed mainly in documents EN 30993 \"Biological evaluation of medical devices, Part 5: Tests for cytotoxicity: in vitro methods\" and \"Biological evaluation of medical devices, Part 12: Sample preparation and reference materials.\" Cells were cultured in microplates and challenged with aqueous extracts of the materials. The assay methods were neutral red- and propidium iodide-uptake assays, both indicative of cell viability and able to provide quantitative data. The observation of contrasting results for one material using the above-mentioned methods raised some concern about the assay system used. With further experimentation, it appeared that a sustained release of volatile substances still present in one extract exerted a toxic effect in neighboring cultures. It is concluded that in the microenvironment of a microplate the distribution of samples cannot be disregarded, as it may be responsible for toxicity cross-contamination. Moreover, the use of more than one single method has to be recommended in cytotoxicity testing, in order to avoid false positive results due to experimental artifacts.",

In this study the level and types of microorganisms found on rigid lumened medical devices before and after cleaning in a hospital environment were investigated. The bioburden level after clinical use was found to be relatively low, ranging from 10(1) to 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) per device. After the instruments were cleaned, none of the devices studied contained bioburden levels greater than 10(4) CFU and 83% had bioburden levels less than or equal to 10(2) CFU. The bioburden present before cleaning was comprised of organisms derived from the handling of the device, from the hospital environment, and from the patient. The bioburden present after cleaning was comprised of organisms typically derived from the handling of the device and from the hospital environment. The level of bioburden per device was also related to the anatomic site where the device was used, with lower numbers of organisms found on devices exposed to sterile body sites and the respiratory tract.",

        "A sensitive measure of the in vitro blood damage potential of a medical device is the rate at which hemoglobin is released into the plasma from red blood cells flowing through the device. Presently there is no one widely accepted method for measuring the plasma hemoglobin concentration. Nine currently used assays, classified as either direct optical or added chemical techniques, were evaluated for accuracy, reproducibility, sensitivity, interference effects, and ease of use by adding hemoglobin (1-200 mg/dl) to saline, lipid, and bilirubin solutions and to normal cow plasma. Most of the assays displayed good linearity, accuracy, and reproducibility down to 1 mg/dl when interferents were absent. However, representative of the effects caused by interferents, the endogenous hemoglobin concentration of a typical cow plasma sample measured by the 9 techniques ranged from -2 to 39 mg/dl. Although used by fewer organizations, some of the direct optical spectrophotometric methods (e.g., the Cripps and Harboe baseline correction methods) are safer, easier, and more precise and accurate than the chemical addition methods used to measure plasma hemoglobin concentration from in vitro blood damage testing of medical devices.",

A growing literature documents how these systems can improve health care delivery, but concerns about patient safety must now be formally addressed. In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) called for discussions on regulation of software programs as medical devices. In response, a consortium of organizations dedicated to improving health care through information technology developed recommendations for the responsible regulation and monitoring of clinical software systems by users, vendors, and regulatory agencies.

        "A plethora of data has been used to condemn and defend the role of silicone and its association with \"adjuvant disease.\" In the ongoing attempt to enhance our knowledge, we have chosen to identify tissue silicon levels in patients with saline implants or tissue expanders. We have compared these levels with tissue samples from a variety of patients with and without medicinal silicone devices from both the northeast and southwest United States over a 4-year period. All specimens were harvested by a \"no touch\" technique, non-formalin fixed, frozen, and shipped to an independent toxicology laboratory for analysis. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy was used to obtain the tissue silicon measurements. Silicon tissue values in cadaveric tissue (n = 20 cadavers; n = 120 specimens) averaged 2.2 mcg/gm of tissue with undetectable silicon levels in over 50 percent of the specimens (range 0 to 45 mcg/gm; median = 0). Silicon levels surrounding port-a-catheter devices (n = 15 patients; n = 15 specimens) averaged 8.04 mcg/gm of tissue (range 0 to 41 mcg/gm; median = 0). Tissue levels in the capsules surrounding saline (n = 10 patients; n = 22 specimens) and silicone implants (n = 31 patients; n = 58 specimens) averaged 292 mcg/gm (range 0 to 1380 mcg/gm; median = 110) and 1439 mcg/gm (range 0 to 9800 mcg/gm, median = 490), respectively. Tissue levels, however, from distant sites (n = 22 specimens) in these same patients were equivalent to the cadaveric nonaugmented values (average = 3.2 mcg/gm; range 0 to 5.8 mcg/gm; median = 2.7). The results imply that there is a continuum of exposure to silicone medical devices based on the mechanical properties of silicone. The data seem to suggest that there may be a progression of measurable tissue silicon levels based on the amount of environmental or device-related silicone exposure a person has over his or her lifetime. It is our hope that these levels will serve as a baseline for our continuing knowledge of implantable medical devices.",
        "Anaphylactic reactions after intravascular exposure to natural rubber latex (NRL) have been reported. Thus, there is an urgent need to produce medical devices with the lowest possible latex-allergen content. The latex-allergen concentration in extracts prepared from 92 lots of medical catheter (MC) balloons, manufactured by Nolato Polymer AB, Torekov, Sweden, from April 1993 to March 1996, was measured with an EAI (IgE antibody inhibition) assay. Inhibitory capacity was expressed in arbitrary units/ml (U/ml) in relation to reference NRL sap, given an arbitrary value of 1000 U. Extracts from randomly selected lots were measured for protein by the modified Lowry method. Water leaching, chlorination, and treatment with savinase were used experimentally to study reduction of the latex-allergen content. The latex-allergen content in extract from the regular MC balloons varied from 0.1 to 2.9 U/ml. All the methods used to reduce the allergen content were effective, and increased leaching stabilized the allergen content at a low level. The protein concentration of the extracts varied between 9 and 100 mg/l. No correlation was found between protein and allergen content. As a result of this study, the manufacturer has extended the stage of water leaching in the production process. This study shows that cooperation between immunologists and manufacturers may result in product development and improvement.",

Although initially successful, smooth implants are prone to develop surrounding scar capsules that may harden and contract, resulting in discomfort, weakening of the shell with rupture, asymmetry, and patient dissatisfaction. This phenomenon has been shown to occur in as many as 70 percent of implanted patients over time. We have reviewed all of our patients and the Medical Device Reporting System for Bioplasty, Inc. (Minneapolis, Minn.) for the history of this device. At 18 months, more textured implants remain soft than the smooth group. After an additional 30 months of follow-up, for a total of 48 months maximum and 18 months minimum, most textured implants still remain soft. Since 1990 we have used AU24K, bio-oncotic hydrogel filling material in molecular impact surface textured implants (MISTI) that is similar to breast tissue in color, radiodensity, and viscosity. Complications have been late leaks, infection, and capsular contracture. Several asymptomatic implants were removed because of anxiety over the FDA controversy. Our experience so far indicates that such a breast implant is a reasonable alternative to the prior art.

        "The segmented polyether urethanes (PEUs) have been used in implantable medical devices due to excellent mechanical properties, acceptable blood compatibility, and good biostability. However, recent studies demonstrate that the polyether soft segment of PEU is susceptible to oxidative degradation in vivo due to scission of the polyether group. Recently, polycarbonate urethanes (PCUs) having no ether linkage in the soft segment have been developed, and show improved stability against oxidative degradation over PEUs. The current study evaluates blood compatibility of these PCUs in comparison with PEUs using epifluorescent video microscopy (EVM) combined with a parallel plate flow cell. The authors selected two PCUs, Corethane 80A (Corvita Corporation, Miami, FL) and PCU(1560), and two PEUs, Pellethene 2363-80AE (Dow Chemical Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and Tecoflex EG80A (Thermedics, Inc., Woburn, MA), all of which have similar hard segment compositions (MDI or HMDI:1,4-butanediol(BD)) and the same hardness of 80A. The EVM measured the amount of platelet coverage on the surfaces using human whole blood perfused at a wall shear rate of 100/sec for 20 min. Complement activation (C3a) also was measured. Both PEUs, especially Pellethane, showed significantly higher platelet adhesion than the PCUs (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in platelet adhesion between the two PCUs. As for C3a measurements, Tecoflex showed higher complement activation than the others. Based on these results, it is recommended that PEUs should be replaced by ether free PCUs for use in implantable blood contacting devices such as artificial hearts and pacemaker lead insulators.",

        "Anesthesia gas delivery equipment is a potentially important source of patient injury. To better define the contribution of gas delivery equipment to professional liability in anesthesia, the authors conducted an in-depth analysis of cases from the database of the American Society of Anesthesiologists Closed Claims Project.\nThe database of the Closed Claims Project is composed of closed US malpractice claims that have been collected in a standardized manner. All claims resulting from the use of gas delivery equipment were reviewed for recurrent patterns of injury.\nGas delivery equipment was associated with 72 (2%) of 3,791 claims in the database. Death and permanent brain damage accounted for almost all adverse outcomes (n = 55, 76%). Equipment misuse was defined as fault or human error associated with the preparation, maintenance, or deployment of a medical device. Equipment failure was defined as unexpected malfunction of a medical device, despite routine maintenance and previous uneventful use. Misuse of equipment (n = 54, 75%) was three times more common than equipment failure (n = 17, 24%). Misconnects and disconnects of the breathing circuit made the largest contribution to injury (n = 25, 35%). Reviewers judged that 38 of 72 claims (53%) could have been prevented by pulse oximetry, capnography, or a combination of these two monitors. Overall, 56 of 72 gas delivery claims (78%) were deemed preventable with the use or better use of monitors. The year of occurrence for claims involving gas delivery equipment ranged from 1962 to 1991 and did not differ significantly from claims involving other adverse respiratory events.\nClaims associated with gas delivery equipment are infrequent but severe and continue to occur in the 1990s. Educational and preventive strategies that focus on equipment misuse and breathing circuit configuration may have the greatest potential for enhancing the safety of anesthesia gas delivery equipment.",
        "Elastic compression stockings are widely used medical devices for the prevention of edema and treatment of venous diseases. Many beneficial effects have been described in the past. The exact amount of pressure underneath elastic compression stockings at different areas of the leg remains controversial.\nTo examine the pressure at the skin underneath class II elastic compression stockings at different places around the ankle at the B level.\nPatients with known venous insufficiency and regularly using class II elastic therapeutic compression stockings (25-35 mm Hg) for venous diseases were included. All subjects were wearing completely new stockings at the time of the study. Measurements were performed with an electropneumatic interface pressure measuring device (Oxford Pressure Monitor MK II) with inflatable small sensoring cells. Six sensors were placed around the smallest circumference at the ankle (B-area). The highest and lowest recordings as well as the means were evaluated.\nThe mean pressure of class II elastic stockings measured around the ankle was 24.7 mm Hg (SD, 8.4). The lowest pressures were found at the medial site (18.3 mm Hg; 74% of the mean), and the highest at the pretibial zone (33.9 mm Hg, 137%).\nThe pressure exerted by pressure class II elastic compression stockings a the medial site just above the ankle (B area) is too low to have influence and improve the venous insufficiency. For phlebology this is the target area. It might be a reason for the high recurrence rate of venous ulcers even if patients wear stockings. Also, the mean pressure of class II stockings was found to be below the normal levels of its pressure class (25-35 mm Hg according to the European CEN classification). The results advocate the use of pressure class III elastic compression stocking more often and the use of pelottes or foam pads.",

A large percentage of total hip complications could be attributed to some aspect of component modularity. Cementless modular acetabular components were the single largest source of device-related complications. Fifty-six percent of total knee medical device reports (MDRs) were associated with accelerated polyethylene wear. By location, MDRs identified patellar (46%), tibial (33%), and femoral (5%) component complications. It was estimated that less than 5% of device-related complications were reported to the FDA. Based on the reports received, it was apparent that mechanical failure of components was a common and increasing cause of total joint revision.",

        "Neutrophils are the major phagocytic white blood cell present during the acute inflammatory response to cardiovascular medical devices and can become activated to release a wide variety of products that help mediate the overall host response. The purpose of this investigation was to develop an in vitro system to study the release of lysosomal enzymes from neutrophils adherent to biomaterial surfaces. Neutrophils isolated from peripheral human blood were allowed to adhere to different biomaterials and lysosomal enzyme release assessed by monitoring elastase-like activity in the supernatant. The number of adherent neutrophils with intact cytoplasmic membranes was estimated by extracting the cells and quantifying lactate dehydrogenase. Stimulated and non-stimulated neutrophils released significantly different amounts of elastase-like activity depending on the biomaterial surface to which they were adhered. The techniques developed in this study form the basis of an in vitro system for investigating the events associated with neutrophil/biomaterial interactions as well as a method for evaluating the white blood cell response to the materials used in circulatory support devices.

        "False-negative cervical Pap smears may lead to disability or death from carcinoma of the uterine cervix. New computer technology has led to the development of an interactive, neural network-based vision instrument to increase the accuracy of cervical smear screening. The instrument belongs to a new class of medical devices designed to provide computer-aided diagnosis (CADx). To test the instrument's performance, 487 archival negative smears (index smears) from 228 women with biopsy-documented high-grade precancerous lesions or invasive cervical carcinoma (index women) were retrieved from the files of 10 participating laboratories that were using federally mandated quality assurance procedures. Samples of sequential negative smears (total 9,666) were retrieved as controls. The instrument was used to identify evidence of missed cytological abnormalities, including atypical squamous or glandular cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS, AGUS), low-grade or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL, HSIL) and carcinoma. Using the instrument, 98 false-negative index smears were identified in 72 of the 228 index women (31.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 25% to 38%). Disregarding the debatable categories of ASCUS or AGUS, there were 44 women whose false-negative smears disclosed squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) or carcinoma (19.3%; 95% CI: 14.2% to 24.4%). Unexpectedly, SILs were also identified in 127 of 9,666 control negative smears (1.3%; 95% CI: 1.1% to 1.5%). Compared with historical performance data from several participating laboratories, the instrument increased the detection rate of SILs in control smears by 25% and increased the yield of quality control rescreening 5.1 times (P < 0.0001). These data provide evidence that conventional screening and quality control rescreening of cervical smears fail to identify a substantial number of abnormalities. A significant improvement in performance of screening of cervical smears could be achieved with the use of the instrument described in this report.",

        "Approximately 800,000 needlesticks and other sharp injuries from contaminated medical devices occur in health care settings each year, of which an estimated 16,000 are contaminated by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Health care workers who are occupationally infected by HIV are at risk of being left without workers' compensation coverage. In some states, the definition of an occupational disease is so restrictive that infected health care workers are unlikely to qualify for benefits. For those who are able to meet the definition, compensation is often inadequate. Recourse is also limited by statutory provisions that preclude health care workers from bringing civil suits against their employers. We recommend the amendment of legislation to provide more equitable remedies, including: (1) broadening the definition of occupational disease; (2) eliminating provisions that require a claimant to prove that (a) a specific occupational incident resulted in infection and (b) HIV is not an ordinary disease of life; (3) expanding the time for filing a claim; (4) assuring that lifetime benefits will be provided to the disabled health care worker; and (5) assuring that claims will remain confidential.",
        "Acidified sodium chlorite (ASC) is recognised as a highly potent, broad spectrum antimicrobial system that has been successfully developed for uses in veterinary, food processing and medical device fields. The current studies aimed to investigate the persistence of antimicrobial action and plaque inhibitory properties of 3 ASC mouthrinses by comparison with positive control, chlorhexidine 0.12%, and placebo control, water, rinses. Both studies were randomised, double-blind, cross-over 5-cell designs balanced for carryover. The 1st study involved 15 healthy subjects who immediately before and at 30, 60, 180, 300 and 420 min after rinsing provided 2 ml saliva samples. The samples were immediately processed for total anaerobic bacterial counts recorded after 96 h incubation. Washout periods were a minimum of 3 days. The second study involved 20 healthy subjects who on day 1 of each study were rendered plaque free, suspended normal oral hygiene methods and commenced rinsing twice daily with the allocated rinse. On day 5, plaque was scored by index and area after disclosing with erythrosin. Washout periods were 2 1/2 days. The 3 ASC and chlorhexidine rinses produced similar reductions in salivary bacterial counts which remained significantly below the placebo control to 7 h. There were no significant differences between ASC and chlorhexidine rinses except at 30 and 60 min when significantly greater reductions were produced by 2 ASC rinses compared to the chlorhexidine rinse. Plaque indices and areas were considerably and significantly lower with the ASC and chlorhexidine rinses compared to the placebo rinse. There were no significant differences between plaque scores for the 3 ASC rinses and the chlorhexidine rinse, although for 2 ASC rinses plaque scores were lower than for the chlorhexidine rinse. The results indicate that the 3 ASC rinses have equivalent plaque inhibitory action to chlorhexidine as a rinse. Similar to chlorhexidine, the plaque inhibitory action of the rinses appears to be derived from a persistence of antimicrobial action in the mouth.",

        "The reuse of disposable devices is a potential source of significant cost savings to hospitals. Venous and arterial perfusion cannulas under new and reused conditions were selected to identify the clinical, safety, technical, logistic, and economic issues that must be addressed to realize these savings.\nSingle- and dual-stage venous and arterial cannulas from two manufacturers were tested when new, after initial clinical use, and after a single clinical use plus up to nine simulated reuses. Reuse was simulated by end-to-end bending, coupling and uncoupling of the connectors, and by two 1-hour soaks in plasma at 4 degrees and 40 degrees C, respectively. Cannulas were decontaminated and then processed by a peracetic acid-based liquid chemical sterilization system after each use/reuse. Sterilization was validated by eliminating Bacillus subtilis spores from the cannulas on each of five consecutive cycles. Cannulas were tested for physical changes, functional integrity, biocompatibility, and in vivo performance in sheep. A cost analysis was also performed.\nSterilization was successfully achieved. Mechanical changes were less than 20% on all variables studied and were undetectable by experienced cardiac surgeons in selective evaluation. No clinically important differences were found between new and reused cannulas, even after nine simulated reuses. Reusing cannulas four times would reduce the cost per procedure from $53 to $19 (64%).\nPreliminary data suggest that the perfusion cannulas tested can be safely and efficaciously used five times. Limited reuse of these disposable cannulas is technically feasible and cost-effective. Cannula reuse would result in a small incremental savings; however, with more expensive devices and higher-volume sterilization procedures, the savings could be considerably greater. This program provides a model for evaluation of other single-use medical devices for reuse.",
        "The mutagenic potential of glutaraldehyde-containing dentin bonding agents was shown in previous studies using a bacterial gene mutation assay, the Ames test. However, current strategies of genotoxicity testing and regulatory requirements for the biological evaluation of medical devices recommend a battery of tests that indicate induced mutations in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Accordingly, the mutagenicity of three glutaraldehyde-containing bonding agents (Syntac adhesive, Prisma Universal Bond 3 adhesive, and Gluma 3) was investigated using a quantitative mammalian cell gene mutation assay (V79/HPRT test) in the present investigation. The materials were extracted in dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1 g/2 mL) for 24 h and original extracts were then serially diluted in cell culture medium before exposure to V79 cells. Cytotoxic and mutagenic effects were observed with identical concentrations of extracts of the different test materials. There was a moderate decrease of the number of surviving cells immediately after the end of exposure. Mutagenicity at the hprt locus in V79 cells was found with all materials tested, and the increases in the absolute numbers of mutants were dose dependent. The mutant frequencies were about 15- (Syntac adhesive and Gluma 3) to 20-fold (Prisma UB3 adhesive) higher than solvent control values. Since other substances than glutaraldehyde may be responsible for the mutagenic effects in mammalian cells in this study, work is currently in progress to identify the individual mutagenic compounds of dentin adhesives and related composite materials.",

        "Automated data capture from bedside patient medical devices is now possible using a new Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (IEEE) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Medical Information Bus (MIB) data communications standard (IEEE 1073). The first two standard documents, IEEE 1073.3.1 (Transportation Profile) and IEEE 1073.4.1 (Physical Layer), define the hardware protocol for bedside device communications. With the above noted IEEE MIB standards in place, hospitals can now start designing customized applications for acquiring data from bedside devices such as bedside monitors, i.v. pumps, ventilators, etc. for multiple purposes. The hardware 'plug and play' features of the MIB will enable nurses and physicians to establish communications with these devices simply and conveniently by plugging them into a bedside data connector. No other action will be necessary to establish identification of the device or communications with the device. Presently to connect bedside devices, technical help from hardware and software experts are required to establish such communications links. As a result of standardization of communications, it will be easy to establish a highly mobile network of bedside devices and more promptly and efficiently collect patient related data. Collection of data automatically should lead to the design of new medical computing applications that will tie in directly with the emerging mission and operations of hospitals. The MIB will permit acquisition of patient data more efficiently with greater accuracy, more completeness and more promptly. The above noted features are all essential to the development of computerized treatment protocols and should lead to improved quality of patient care. This manuscript provides the rational and historical overview of the development of the MIB standard.",
        "Local therapy of middle and inner ear diseases is being used, but is restricted to cases of ear drum perforation or to repeated invasive intratympanic drug application by the physician. In accordance with the Medical Device Directive (class III), a bone-anchored, totally implantable drug delivery system (TI-DDS) has been developed. It includes a micropump for subcutaneous, patient-controlled activation, a drug reservoir and a septum port. A thin guide-wired catheter leads from the pump outlet to the point of application in the mastoid or middle ear cavities. Local inner ear therapy with suitable drugs is possible by positioning the catheter's end near the round window membrane. The system requires no battery and will offer a wide range of patient-controlled bolus applications (25 microliters per activation). We first analyzed the three-dimensional implantation geometry of the mastoid cavity. Basic micromechanical problems have been solved in order to create several prototypes. The TI-DDS has already undergone extensive in vitro testing. Recent results of pump rate precision and digital pressure force testing are promising. Local drug treatment for conditions such as lidocaine-sensitive tinnitus, secretory otitis media, Meniere's disease, localized pain and intralesional cancer is under discussion. Furthermore, local application of future biotechnological trophic factors for inner ear treatment is anticipated. The basic engineering is completed and initial animal tests are in preparation.",
        "Workers at a Nogales, Mexico, maquiladora plant that assembles medical devices were studied to determine the prevalence of upper-extremity cumulative trauma disorders (CTD). Subjects included production workers employed 6 months or longer; of the 148 eligible workers, 145 (98%) participated. Subjects had a mean age of 24.6 years (SD = 5.2; range, 17 to 45) and the mean length of employment was 3.5 years (SD = 2.5; range, 0.5 to 14). Job tasks were videotaped and analyzed for ergonomic risk factors, using pre-defined criteria. All jobs performed by study subjects were found to involve one or more ergonomic risk factors associated with the development of CTD. A CTD questionnaire and screening physical examination format, similar to that used by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in a chicken processing plant study, were administered. Period prevalence of CTD within the previous year, as reported on the questionnaire, was 28%. Prevalence of CTD was 17%, using data from the screening physical examination. Point prevalence (current pain data from the questionnaire plus positive symptoms on the screening physical examination) was 15%. CTD was reported more frequently in women than men (46% and 25%, respectively; P < 0.05) and in subjects who had worked at the plant less than one year (50%; P < 0.05). Workforce turnover (3% monthly) may have resulted in those affected by CTD leaving employment, reducing the apparent CTD rate in experienced workers.",
        "To review the literature addressing the issue of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) moratorium on use of the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC).\nPertinent English language articles dealing with medical devices including the PAC were retrieved from 1976 through 1996.\nArticles were chosen if issues related to medical devices were studied or reviewed.\nFrom the articles selected, information about the 1976 Medical Device Amendment and the PAC was obtained.\nIn 1976, the Medical Device Amendment gave the FDA power over medical devices. The pulmonary artery catheter is considered a class II device and was on the market before passage of the 1976 Act. Class II devices require general and specific controls to reasonably assure safety and effectiveness. A reasonable assurance of safety occurs when the probable benefits to health from the use of the device outweigh any probable risks. If a monitor measures an established and well-understood variable and the intended use claim is limited to the measurement of that variable, then the effectiveness consists of determining device safety and performance defined as the measurement of agreement with a recognized reference method. Deaths and serious injuries secondary to pulmonary artery catheterization are extremely rare despite more than 25 years of use. Pulmonary artery catheter manufacturer's indications for use are measurements such as hemodynamic pressures, thermodilution cardiac output, continuous cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and blood sampling; intended uses have not included claims of clinical benefit. Evidence exists that pulmonary artery catheterization provides agreement with established measurements including pressure and cardiac output. Evidence also exists that pulmonary artery catheter derived data are unobtainable clinically, that the derived data helps in therapy changes and may lead to more appropriate therapy. The evidence demonstrates an absence of unreasonable risk of injury from pulmonary artery catheterization and provision of important clinical results. Therefore, pulmonary artery catheterization meets FDA requirements for safety and effectiveness.\nAn FDA moratorium on the use of the PAC is not indicated.",

Application of 70 kHz ultrasonic irradiation to gentamicin treatment greatly enhanced the action of the antibiotic in terms of reduced viable bacterial concentrations. Ultrasonic irradiation was carried out at various insonation intensities that were noninhibitory in the absence of antibiotic. Synergistic killing was observed to be a function of ultrasonic intensity. Greatest killing (approximately 5 log reduction in viable population) was realized at full intensity (4.5 W/cm2), and decreased with reductions in power density. At lowest intensity (10 mW/cm2), no significant acoustic enhanced killing was noted.",

        "A multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to test the efficacy of a specifically programmed, low-intensity, non-thermal, pulsed ultrasound medical device for shortening the time to radiographic healing of dorsally angulated fractures (negative volar angulation) of the distal aspect of the radius that had been treated with manipulation and a cast. Sixty patients (sixty-one fractures) were enrolled in the study within seven days after the fracture. The patients used either an active ultrasound device (thirty fractures) or a placebo device (thirty-one fractures) daily for twenty minutes at home for ten weeks. The two types of devices were identical except that the placebo devices emitted no ultrasound energy. Clinical examination was performed and radiographs were made at one, two, three, four, five, six, eight, ten, twelve, and sixteen weeks after the fracture by each site investigator. The time to union was significantly shorter for the fractures that were treated with ultrasound than it was for those that were treated with the placebo (mean [and standard error], 61 +/- 3 days compared with 98 +/- 5 days; p < 0.0001). Each radiographic stage of healing also was significantly accelerated in the group that was treated with ultrasound as compared with that treated with the placebo. Compared with treatment with the placebo, treatment with ultrasound was associated with a significantly smaller loss of reduction (20 +/- 6 per cent compared with 43 +/- 8 per cent; p < 0.01), as determined by the degree of volar angulation, as well as with a significant decrease in the mean time until the loss of reduction ceased (12 +/- 4 days compared with 25 +/- 4 days; p < 0.04). We concluded that this specific ultrasound signal accelerates the healing of fractures of the distal radial metaphysis and decreases the loss of reduction during fracture-healing.",
        "A wireless biotelemetry system for the transfer of digital data through intact skin and tissue has been developed to provide a safe and noninvasive means of communication between implanted medical devices and the outside of the body. The system utilizes 2 miniature infrared transmitter/receiver modules. Data are transmitted through intact skin and subcutaneous tissue on an 890 nm infrared carrier signal. The system has been evaluated in human cadavers and during in vivo implantation of artificial hearts and ventricular assist devices for durations of up to 96 h. Acceptable data transfer (error rate < 10(-5)) through a typical tissue thickness of 5-25 mm has been demonstrated. The ability to monitor and control a device from a remote site using public communication systems such as telephone lines and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) systems has also been demonstrated. Design optimization is currently ongoing in preparation for clinical utilization with artificial heart systems and other implantable devices (such as rotary blood pumps).",
        "Living beings communicate with their world nonverbally, whether on a somatic or a psychological level. This paradigm of signifiers or sense takes place in the framework of the logic of analogy. The signifier is the semantic object that materially designates information to be transmitted and dealt with; a homeopathic remedy is the mimetic representation of the disease. Differential levels of information organize the spread of signifiers; each level is the result of regulation and integration of the previous level. The living self is the never-ending process whereby levels of information are synthesized in the face of the informing environment. Such representations meet one another in the communication between the patient and the physician-remedy system. The medical device must reinform the patient and make the patient's signs and symptoms move toward a higher level of integration. The dilution of the remedy permits us to receive and treat it as information about disease. Signs and symptoms can be recognized as an erroneous adaptation; the organism is engaged in a process of paradoxical negation. The action of the remedies consists of a dynamic analogy between pieces of information. The paradigm of signifiers offers a new possibility for the exploration of informative therapeutics.",
        "To test stability of insulin lispro in two insulin infusion systems over 48 h.\nWe used reverse-phase and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the purity, potency, and degree of polymerization of U100 insulin lispro (Humalog) after 24- and 48-h pump cycles conducted at 37 degrees C in five Disetronic H-TRON V100 and five MiniMed 504 pumps. Pumps were set to deliver a basal rate of 0.5 U/h and 6-U boluses at t = 0, 4, 8, 24, 24.5, 28.5, 32.5, and 48 h during each cycle. The effluent was collected into 1-ml vials, pooled at 24 or 48 h, and stored at 4 degrees C until assay. After each 48-h run period of insulin delivery, assays for potency, polymer, and purity were performed on the pooled samples from each individual cycle. m-cresol content and the pooled reservoir content were assayed in the 48-h pooled samples.\nInsulin lispro retained full HPLC potency (delta < or = 4%) at 48 h, with no degradation of insulin lispro to des-amidoinsulin forms (24 or 48 h). No increase in pumped insulin polymer concentration was observed following 24 h of pump flow. Nonsignificant increases of < or =0.09% (Disetronic) and < or =0.15% (MiniMed) from initial concentrations of 0.18% (polymer divided by total insulin) were detected in three of five pump cycles at 48 h when compared with 37 degrees C paired controls. Nonsignificant decreases (<5 and 10%, Disetronic and MiniMed, respectively) of m-cresol content occurred in both systems following 48 h storage in each device, but sterility was not compromised by this decrease (initial m-cresol concentration, 3.15 mg/ml). Pump performance was without mechanical or electrical fault throughout the study Basal and bolus insulin delivery was evaluated three times daily and remained as expected. Occlusion of catheters by insulin precipitation did not occur, and no change in pH was observed following delivery.\nWe conclude that insulin lispro is suitable for prolonged infusion in these two medical devices when syringes and catheters are replaced at 48-h intervals.",
        "Staphylococcus epidermidis has been recognized as an important pathogen in immunocompromised hosts and patients with prosthetic or implanted medical devices. A highly adhesive extracellular material (slime or biofilm) produced by certain strains is associated with bacterial adherence to and growth on biomaterials contributing to pathogenesis of bacteremia. We have recently reported on the isolation and characterization of a sulfated 20-kDa acidic polysaccharide which constitutes slime's major component. Immunization of rabbits with crude slime and 20-kDa polysaccharide gave rise to readily reactive sera without manipulation of the 20-kDa polysaccharide structure. Immunological studies using purified polyclonal antibodies to 20-kDa polysaccharide by direct and competitive ELISA showed that they exhibit a high degree of reactivity and specificity with the homologous antigen. A significant proportion of the reactivity of antibodies to crude slime was also shown to be attributed to the 20-kDa polysaccharide. This polysaccharide is immunogenic in humans since blood sera derived from patients 10-15 days after confirmation of slime-producing S. epidermidis bacteremia gave approximately 16 times higher reactivity than that of healthy individuals. Antibodies to 20-kDa polysaccharide were able to recognize and react specifically with slime-positive S. epidermidis strains compared to slime-negative ones (2 to 5 times higher reactivity). Moreover, these antibodies exhibited statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences in the degree of reactivity among S. epidermidis and other staphylococci species. These results open a new area in the diagnosis of S. epidermidis infection by direct analysis in blood sera, in differentiating among slime-positive and slime-negative strains as well as in distinguishing slime-producing S. epidermidis from other staphylococci species by simple laboratory tests.",

        "Quality by design is a comprehensive program that begins with understanding user needs and continues through (but does not end with) monitoring customer acceptance. Management tools and processes such as ISO 9000 standards and the Food and Drug Administration Quality System Regulations exist to guide medical device manufacturers in quality practices. The goal is to deliver products acceptable for their intended use. Quality control begins with defining attributes ranging from color to accuracy and precision. Failure mode and effects analysis and risk analysis consider both probability and severity of potential malfunctions and their effects on patients or operators. Tools used to implement design and production practices include Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) charts and industry-conceived concepts, such as Six Sigma techniques. Their use varies with manufacturer, depending on product and customer needs and the manufacturer's specific quality practices. Verification confirms that input goals are met. Then, validation assures that intended clinical needs are continually satisfied by establishing adequate production specifications. Conformance is monitored to verify that stable, consistent processes are in place, and precise user instructions enable the device to satisfy its intended use. Finally, complaint tracking can help assess whether needs have been met. Modifications in service, hardware, or instructions (including quality control) might be required. Therefore, both manufacturers and users work in partnership for continual improvement. The manufacturer's knowledge of design, production, and service needs of its devices enable it to recommend appropriate quality-control protocols for clinical testing.",
        "Highly purified algin preparations free of adverse contaminants with endotoxins and other mitogens recently became available by a new purification process (Kl\u00f6ck et al., Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 1994, 40, 638-643). An advantage of this purification protocol is that it can be applied to alginates with various ratios of mannuronic acid to guluronic acid. High mannuronic acid alginate capsules are of particular practical interest for cell transplantation and for biohybrid organs, because mannuronate-rich alginates are usually less viscous, allowing one to make gels with a higher alginate content. This will increase their stability and reduce the diffusion permeability and could therefore protect immobilized cells more efficiently against the host immune system. Here we report the biocompatibility of purified, mannuronic acid-rich alginate (68% mannuronate residues) in a series of in vitro, as well as in vivo, assays. In contrast to raw alginate extracts, the purified product showed no mitogenic activity towards murine lymphocytes in vitro. Its endotoxin content was reduced to the level of the solvent. Animal studies with these new, purified algin formulations revealed the absence of a mitogen-induced foreign body reaction, even when the purified material (after cross-linking with Ba2+ ions) is implanted into animal models with elevated macrophage activity (diabetes-prone BB/OK rat). Thus, alginate capsules with high mannuronic acid content become available for applications such as implantation. In addition to the utilization as implantable cell reactors in therapy and biotechnology, these purified algins have broad application potential as ocular fillings, tissue replacements, microencapsulated growth factors and/or interleukins or slow-release dosage forms of antibodies, surface coatings of sensors and other invasive medical devices, and in encapsulation of genetically engineered cells for gene therapy.",

        "To determine the exposure to, and evaluate the potential toxicity from, the plasticizer, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy.\nProtocol 1 consisted of a prospective comparison of three ECMO circuit designs in vitro. Protocol 2 consisted of a prospective, comparative clinical study evaluating DEHP plasma concentrations in ECMO vs. non-ECMO patients with respiratory failure.\nNeonatal intensive care unit at The Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC.\nIn protocol 2, 28 consecutive term infants were referred for ECMO therapy. Eighteen infants required ECMO; ten control patients received conventional ventilation and improved without ECMO.\nIn protocol 1, three ECMO circuit designs were primed in vitro with normal saline, albumin, and human blood, which was maintained at 37 degrees C and recirculated at 400 mL/min for 48 hrs. Plasma samples were obtained at time 0, 1 hr, and every 6 hrs. In protocol 2, ventilatory and cardiovascular management of the patients in the study was conducted by the attending physician. Patients were placed on ECMO when they met the institutional criteria for ECMO therapy. Daily plasma concentrations for DEHP were collected until 3 days after decannulation from bypass in the ECMO group. Control patients were sampled daily until extubation. Evidence of cardiac, liver, or lung toxicity was evaluated by Chest Radiographic Scores, liver function studies, and echocardiograms obtained on day 1, day 3, and the day of decannulation in the ECMO group, or at the time of extubation in the control group. Sedation, blood product transfusions as indicated, antibiotics, and hyperalimentation were administered to all patients.\nAll DEHP plasma concentrations were measured by gas chromatography. In protocol 1, three circuits were studied: circuit A (small surface area); circuit B (larger surface area); and circuit C (surface area of A but with heparin-bonded tubing in the circuit). DEHP leached from circuit A at 0.32 +/- 0.12 microgram/ mL/hr, compared with 0.57 +/- 0.14 microgram/mL/hr from circuit B (p < .05). This amount of DEHP extrapolates in the ECMO patient to a potential exposure of 20 to 70 times that exposure from other medical devices or procedures, such as transfusions, dialysis, or short-term cardiopulmonary bypass. Circuit C showed almost no leaching from the circuit; DEHP concentrations decreased at a rate of 0.2 +/- 0.04 microgram/mL/ hr. In protocol 2, DEHP was undetected in the control patients. DEHP concentrations in ECMO patients were greater in the early course of ECMO. However, most patients cleared this compound from the plasma before decannulation. In contrast to the in vitro results in protocol 1, the average highest concentration at any time on bypass was 8.3 +/- 5.7 micrograms/mL or 2 mg/kg.\nDEHP leaches from ECMO circuits, with potential exposure concentrations related to the surface area of the tubing in the ECMO circuit. Heparin bonding of the tubing eliminates this risk. Although significant concentrations of DEHP leach from the nonheparin-bonded circuits over time, our in vivo studies showed that the DEHP plasma concentrations were less than the previously reported values and do not correlate with any observable short-term toxicity. This compound may be either efficiently metabolized by the newborn, or redistributed into various tissues.

        "A plethora of data has been used to condemn and defend the role of silicone and its association with \"adjuvant disease.\" In the ongoing attempt to enhance our knowledge, we have chosen to identify tissue silicon levels (n = 15) in capsules that form around chemotherapeutic port-a-catheter devices, which consist of a metal dome encapsuled by silicone. We have compared these levels with previously established silicon levels in augmented breast capsules, distant tissue sites in these same augmented women, and nonaugmented cadaveric tissues from various geographic locations in the United States. All specimens were harvested by a \"no touch\" technique, not formalin fixed, frozen, and shipped to an independent toxicology laboratory for analysis. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy was employed to obtain the tissue silicon measurements. Results demonstrated silicon values ranging from nondetectable in 9 patients to as high as 41 micrograms/gm. These values fell in between our cadaveric (0.5 to 6.8 micrograms/gm) and augmented tissue silicon levels (18 to 8700 micrograms/gm). Although the sample size is small and the power of statistical analysis is low, there was no correlation between the patient's silicon level and age, type of cancer, type of chemotherapeutic agent, radiation therapy, or length of time the port-a-catheters were in place. Although detectable levels of silicon identified around port-a-catheter devices were higher than expected, it is impossible to make any conclusions about these levels and the role of a potential collagen-vascular disease. What we have shown, however, is that silicone breast implants may not be the only medical device that can elevate tissue silicon levels. Our data seem to suggest that there may be a progression of measurable tissue silicon levels based on the amount of environmental or device-related silicon exposure a person has had at a particular time in his or her life. It is our belief that as we identify these tissue silicon levels, they will serve as a baseline and reference for further scientific studies.",

Tissue culture assays are currently the most popular in vitro tests for evaluating acute toxicity. The possibility of applying two bioassays using microorganisms in assessing the toxicity of extracts of medical devices was investigated. The Microtox test system--a luminescent bacteria toxicity test--assesses changes in light output from a luminescent bacteria, Vibrio fischeri. Spirotox used a large ciliate protozoan: Spirostomum ambiguum. The most widely used extraction solvent, 0.9% NaCl, must be concentrated up to 2% for Microtox and diluted nine times for the Spirotox test. The organic solvents ethanol, DMSO, and polyethylene glycol 400 were not toxic in either test in concentrations of 1-2%. The toxicity of reference compounds Hg, Cd, Zn, Pb, and SDS was examined in various diluents. The sequence of toxicity of the tested compounds in Spirotox and Microtox was: Hg > Cd > Zn > Pb > SDS, and Hg > Pb = Zn > SDS > Cd, respectively. Addition of organic solvents changed the toxicity of compounds tested in 60% of Spirotox tests and only in 25% of Microtox tests. Changes were low, not exceeding 100% in almost all cases.

        "The use of dental implants has become a predictable and frequently used treatment modality in partially and fully edentulous patients. In 1987, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified dental implants as class III medical devices. In 1989, a proposed rule was published by the FDA calling for a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) for dental implants. A PMA requires the demonstration of safety and effectiveness through clinical trials. Although the effective date for Premarket Approvals and detailed information on study requirements have not been announced, many implant manufacturers have already initiated multi-center clinical trials.

        "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulated medical devices since May 1976, when the Medical Device Amendments were enacted. The clinical trial requirements for the marketing of periodontal regeneration devices have been dependent, in part, on the degree of their similarity to devices marketed prior to the legislative enactment date in terms of materials, indication statements, and labeling claims. Nonresorbable barriers were allowed to be marketed based on their equivalence to devices marketed prior to the enactment date based on biocompatability and clinical trial data under the premarket notification requirements section of the law. Bone filling materials such as hydroxyapatite were first marketed based on the finding of equivalence to predicate devices. Newer technologies such as bioabsorbable barriers have also been reviewed under the premarket notification provisions of the law, but manufacturers have been required to provide more extensive safety and effectiveness data to establish equivalence to pre-Amendments devices. Data to answer questions related to the potential toxicity of breakdown products, period of absorption, and ultimate clinical effectiveness needed to be answered prior to marketing. New devices that incorporate technologies that are not substantially equivalent to predicate devices must proceed through the premarket approval route to marketing. For new devices considered a potential significant risk to the patient population, clinical trials are conducted via the investigational device exemption (IDE) requirements that specify the means by which trials will proceed in order to protect the rights of patients. New devices of organic origin, such as bone morphogenic protein, have followed the premarket approval route with IDE requirements instituted as a condition for their path to the marketplace. Issues associated with immediate and long-term contact including potential toxicity, tumorigenicity, and sensitization need to be addressed with appropriate animal models.",
        "Electromagnetic interference (EMI) with medical devices can threaten patient safety. More information is needed regarding circumstances in health care environments in which electromagnetic (EM) field strengths are expected to be high, such as emergency/transport. In ambulances medical devices and communications equipment must function properly in close proximity. This study characterized EM fields in and around ambulances under realistic conditions. Two types of ambulances were surveyed: the advanced life support (ALS) unit and the basic life support (BLS) unit. The surveys were conducted on-site using the ambulance mobile radio as the primary source of EM energy. Broadband field-strength measurements were collected at various locations in and around the ambulance to map interior and exterior EM field distributions. Nine ambulances were surveyed. In addition to the transmitter power and frequency, the field strengths measured were shown to be dependent upon the shielding provided by the ambulance roof and proximity of the measurement probe to the antenna. Field-strength measurements frequently exceeded the 3 V/m standard immunity level for devices set by the IEC Standard 601-1-2. The results indicate that the ambulance environment presents a considerable challenge to medical devices specifically used for emergency medical care. In order to assure their proper operation, medical devices used for transport emergency care must be able to withstand exposure to EM field strengths comparable to those reported in this study.",
        "To effectively implement the design controls required by Quality System regulation, medical device manufacturers need to structure and streamline their design and development process and integrate specific design controls at appropriate stages of the process. Procedures should be written and understood by all levels of the organization to ensure the adequate control of the design and development activities. These procedures should ensure that the following elements are part of the product development process: crossfunctional participation and coordination; precise and accurate user requirements; comprehensive and controlled design specifications; a plan to direct and control the product development activities; methods established to verify and validate the design; predetermined acceptance criteria and rationale; risk analysis and human factors engineering; formal change control and approval; documented traceability of design output to input requirements; qualification of components and sources; project control through effective leadership; multifunctional review; senior management involvement. Most important, medical device manufacturers must tailor the design control requirements of the Quality System regulation and the concepts presented in the Design Control Guidance to their specific needs. Practical consideration must be given to the technological complexity of their devices and the risks associated with the intended use of the devices. However, manufacturers must be in a position to defend the adequacy of the design controls they have implemented and to demonstrate their compliance with these controls. With respect to the enforcement of design control regulations, the FDA must ensure that investigators are adequately trained to provide a consistent and reasonable assessment of a manufacturer's process, methods, and procedures for design control.",
        "Determination of the ability of a medical device to interact with the immune system currently involves assessment of the immunogenic potential and biocompatibility of the device or an extract of the device. However, implants are often in the body for extended periods of time and/or are placed by a surgical procedure that in and of itself will generate an acute inflammatory response. This symposium discussed studies that have been performed to evaluate the immunogenicity of various devices consisting of several different compositions (i.e., silicone, metals, and latex) in contact with different anatomical sites, the ability of a device to modulate an inflammatory response generated by a surgical procedure or trauma, and the response of the body to a material left in place for extended periods of time. This symposium brought together scientists from many different disciplines to begin to identify and fill in the gaps in this area.",

        "Coagulase-negative staphylococci are well recognized in medical device-associated infections. Complement activation is known to occur at the biomaterial surface, resulting in unspecific inflammation around the biomaterial. The human serum protein vitronectin (Vn), a potent inhibitor of complement activation by formation of an inactive terminal complement complex, adsorbs to biomaterial surfaces in contact with blood. In this report, we discuss the possibility that surface-immobilized Vn inhibits complement activation and the effect of Vn-binding staphylococci on complement activation on surfaces precoated with Vn. The extent of complement activation was measured with a rabbit anti-human C3c antibody and a mouse anti-human C9 antibody, raised against the neoepitope of C9. Our data show that Vn immobilized on a biomaterial surface retains its ability to inhibit complement activation. The additive complement activation-inhibitory effect of Vn on a heparinized surface is very small. In the presence of Vn-binding strain, Staphylococcus hemolyticus SM131, complement activation on a surface precoated with Vn occurred as it did in the absence of Vn precoating. For S. epidermidis 3380, which does not express binding of Vn, complement activation on a Vn-precoated surface was significantly decreased. The results could be repeated on heparinized surfaces. These data suggest that Vn adsorbed to a biomaterial surface may serve to protect against surface-associated complement activation. Furthermore, Vn-binding staphylococcal cells may enhance surface-associated complement activation by blocking the inhibitory effect of preadsorbed Vn.",

Originally drafted in 1989, the rules spawned an eight-year controversy, largely because they proposed making \"cost-effectiveness\" one factor in deciding whether certain procedures would be reimbursed. It was one of the first attempts to articulate the precise role cost-effectiveness should play in coverage policy in either the public or private sectors. Many groups opposed the introduction of cost-effectiveness into the equation, but none so actively as medical device manufacturers, represented by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA). Following are excerpts from their exchanges, beginning with HCFA's proposed rule in January of 1989.",

        "National standards govern the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in the United States, including those for indirect blood pressure measurement in man. There are no comparable standards for devices for recording in laboratory animals. Noninvasive tail cuff blood pressure (BP) recording in the rat is widely accepted, but beset by methodologic difficulties. Intraarterial recording is regarded as the \"gold standard\" but is invasive and also susceptible to methodologic error. We compared the IITC Mark 12 photoelectric/oscillometric tail cuff system (IITC Life Sciences, Woodland Hills, CA) versus simultaneous femoral intraarterial recordings in spontaneously hypertensive rats, during anesthesia and 1 to 2 days after recover (150 recordings under each condition), according to the guidelines for human data collection and analysis suggested the American National Standard for automated sphygmomanometers. Within- and between-observer disagreements in estimates made by two observers from 40 anesthetized recordings were less for intraarterial measurements than for the tail cuff method. Within-observer differences (mean +/- SD of differences [SDD]) for systolic, diastolic, and mean pressure were 0 +/- 1, 0 +/- 1, and 0 +/- 1 mm Hg for intraarterial versus -1 +/- 3, 0 +/- 8, and 0 +/- 5 mm Hg for tail cuff. Between-observer differences were 0 +/- 2, 0 +/- 1, and 6 +/- 2 mm Hg versus 5 +/- 4, 13 +/- 7, and 0 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively. Differences between tail cuff and intraarterial methods were 16 +/- 13, -5 +/- 11, and 2 +/- 8 mm Hg in anesthetized animals and 8 +/- 14, -5 +/- 9, and 0 +/- 9 mm Hg in conscious animals (39% to 82% of differences exceeded 5 mm Hg). The upper limits of clinically acceptable disagreement in the American National Standard are: mean of 5 mm Hg, SDD of 8 mm Hg. The disagreement between tail cuff and intraarterial recordings cannot be ascribed to either method with certainty. These findings do not support the manufacturer's guarantee of tail-cuff readings within \"5 mm Hg of intraarterial.\" Inaccuracy and unreliability of devices intended for laboratory animal use have considerable scientific, fiscal, and ethical implications. Marketing of these devices should also be governed by rigorous standards.",
        "The role of the Food and Drug Administration in regulating medical devices generally is not well understood by physicians. The practice of medicine does not fall under Food and Drug Administrations's regulatory purview. Nevertheless, the Food and Drug Administration and its regulation of medical devices can influence physicians' activities. This article provides an overview of the scope of the Food and Drug Administration's authority and the agency's regulatory framework, with particular focus on orthopaedic medical devices as related to spinal implant devices. During the past 10 years, a regulatory dilemma has arisen surrounding the use of bone screws in the pedicles of the spine. Except for recent clearances for a limited treatment indication, the Food and Drug Administration has not cleared these devices to be labeled for pedicle screw fixation and, therefore, has restricted industry supported educational activities pertaining to this type of treatment. In spite of the Food and Drug Administration's regulatory position, physicians have chosen to use pedicle screw fixation in treating patients who have a variety of spinal disorders. This use is now considered an accepted (state of the art) medical practice by many physicians for certain spinal conditions. This article explores this specific Food and Drug Administration regulatory issue, its impact on physicians and manufacturers (especially as it pertains to medical education), and recent actions taken to resolve it.",
        "Medical devices emitting pulsed electric and electromagnetic fields have been found to be effective for a number of clinical applications including stimulation of bone and tissue growth. To determine whether pulsed fields of the type used in these clinical applications present a mutagenic hazard, electric and electromagnetic fields at two exposure levels were tested in the Ames test, CHO cell chromosomal aberration assay, BALB/3T3 cell transformation assay and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in primary rat hepatocytes. For both field types, initial and independent repeat studies were performed for each assay at both clinical and supra clinical doses. In all assays, the results show a lack of cytotoxic, transforming and mutagenic activity. The data suggest that pulsed electric and electromagnetic fields of the type and dose levels used in bone growth stimulation lack mutagenic and transforming activity.",

We have screened 20 chemicals (MEIC codes 31-50) from the programme, by using a cytotoxicity test based on growth inhibition of the mouse fibroblast-like L-929 cell line. Inhibition of cell growth was determined by the neutral red uptake method, which is well established and is used for screening the cytotoxicity of chemicals and plastics for pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The concentrations causing 50% inhibition of cell growth after a 72-hour exposure period varied from 3.1\u03bcM for hexachlorophene, to 1.4mM for caffeine. This is within the same range as results recently obtained with five other cell models. However, with some chemicals (chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and dichloromethane), no reliable results were obtained. These substances could not be dissolved in a reproducible way in any of the solvents used and, furthermore, they were highly volatile, which led to difficulties in maintaining the concentrations. ",
        "Catheters and other interventional medical devices are presently guided by X-ray imaging, despite the advantages of ultrasound imaging over X-ray imaging in cost, safety, and availability. X-ray imaging is used because ultrasound reflects specularly from catheters and similar devices; their visibility is highly angle-dependent. With an omni-directional receiver mounted on a device, the receiver's location in the ultrasound image can be deduced from knowing which acoustic ray struck the receiver and the time from transmission of the imaging pulse to its reception by the receiver. This information is independent of specular reflection. The location of the device can then be indicated in the ultrasound image by an arrow pointing to the sensor, making possible ultrasound guidance of these devices. This paper describes the technical and practical considerations in the design and construction of the device-mounted receiver and associated electronics, and describes some clinical uses.",

        "Custom latex tubing is often used in medical device evaluation. Examples include thin-walled devices used to reduce leakage of porous vascular grafts, and thicker-walled prototypes used as mechanically equivalent synthetic arteries. Medical devices such as stents and balloons are introduced into these for mechanically comparable in vitro testing. The three-dimensional mechanical properties of these tubes are critically important, particularly in accelerated testing, since they are primarily designed to replicate the mechanical rather than biological properties of in vivo arteries. This paper explores the instrumentation and protocols necessary to evaluate the frequency dependent radial compliance of precision built latex tubing. Five cm long samples of custom dipped latex tubing 6 mm in diameter with wall thickness from 0.015\" to 0.033\" were kept dry or soaked in 37 degrees C phosphate buffered saline for 48 or 96 hours before being mounted on a dynamic internal compliance tester. Each tube was tested initially at 70 bpm to establish the internal radial compliance at the physiologically relevant rate. The frequency of the test was then increased incrementally and the radial compliance re-checked. In the most extreme case, tubes were tested up to 2700 bpm. In each case, the volume, pressure, and length of the tube was monitored continuously.",

        "Staphylococcal infections constitute one of the main problems associated with clinical applications of various prosthetic medical devices (biomaterials). As the magnitude of the infection risk depends often on the duration of device installation, and the incidence of infections is higher in skin-penetrating devices, we studied some parameters of specific immune response to staphylococcal antigens in mice subcutaneously (s.c.) implanted for three months with heparinized polyethylene (H-PE). Three weeks before the evaluation of immune response, mice (implanted and non-implanted) were s.c. infected with 10(7) of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1. The proliferation of lymph node cells was determined on the basis of 3H-thymidine incorporation in 3-days cultures stimulated with: staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid (LTA), protein A (SpA), alpha-toxin, or with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Moreover, the levels of specific antibodies to staphylococcal antigens were determined in serum samples (ELISA against: LTA, SpA, alpha-toxin). The data obtained indicate that long-lasting implantation caused evident changes in proliferative activity of lymphocytes and humoral response to staphylococcal antigens. It enhances alpha-toxin and LTA stimulated proliferation of lymph node lymphocytes in vitro. In contrast, H-PE-implanted animals demonstrated a significant decrease in the production of anti-SpA IgG2a and IgG2b and increase in the synthesis of anti-LTA IgG1 antibodies.",
        "Biomedical engineering is responsible for many of the dramatic advances in modern medicine. This has resulted in improved medical care and better quality of life for patients. However, biomedical technology has also contributed to new ethical dilemmas and has challenged some of our moral values. Bioengineers often lack adequate training in facing these moral and ethical problems. These include conflicts of interest, allocation of scarce resources, research misconduct, animal experimentation, and clinical trials for new medical devices. This paper is a compilation of our previous published papers on these topics, and it summarizes many complex ethical issues that a bioengineer may face during his or her research career or professional practice. The need for ethics training in the education of a bioengineering student is emphasized. We also advocate the adoption of a code of ethics for bioengineers.",

Today professionals face an inevitable choice between two opposing moral orders, one based in the primacy of ethical obligations to the sick, the other in the primacy of self-interest and the marketplace. Some medical ethicists urge, reshape ethical codes to conform to the ethos of the marketplace, which legitimates self-interest over beneficence and makes vices out of most of traditional virtues. Second opinion represents the ethicists who recommend a firm stand in belief that being a physician imposes certain specific obligations. Medicine is at heart a moral enterprise and those who practice it are de facto members of a moral community. The market introduces an alien-till this time unknown-set of economic values into an institution (medicine) whose inherent ends are altruistic, but in countries under health care reform it brings a complex of special ethical issues in connection with deficient legislation and not firm ethical rules adopted.

        "Biologic tissue stabilized by dye-mediated photooxidation has found application in implantable devices. The desire to avoid aldehydes in the processing of photooxidized tissues led to the development of a nonaldehyde, iodine based sterilant. The interaction of tissue with iodine was indicated by a change in tissue shrinkage temperature, dependent upon solution and incubation parameters. The amino acid tyrosine also was altered, presumably because of aromatic ring iodination. Transmission electron microscopic study indicated no change in the quarter staggered array structure of collagen under controlled iodine treatment conditions. The D10 values for iodine kill of several organisms, in the absence of tissue, were determined in 0.1% iodine (pH 6.5) at 37 degrees C for Bacillus subtilis (12 min, Aspergillus niger, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (all < 1 min). In a separate experiment, samples of 0.1% iodine (pH 6.5) containing photooxidized pericardial tissue were inoculated with 1.6 X 10(7) Bacillus subtilis, 4.6 X 10(6) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or 7.2 X 10(6) Staphylococcus aureus and incubated at 37 degrees C.

Valve testing under pulsatile conditions is the best in vitro simulation of cardiac valve function, and the ensuing results should support the surgeon's decision concerning the time of valve replacement. However, limits in hydraulic reproduction of cardiac function and differences in protocol implementation of in vitro testing lead to difficulties in obtaining reliable and comparable results. Debate among researchers and standardizing bodies about discrepancies in results becomes critical in light of the European CE certification of implantable medical devices. An interlaboratory environment has been created at the Biomedical Engineering unit of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita in Rome, which uses differing test apparatus to evaluate prosthetic heart valves in vitro, in order to define significant measurement parameters and procedures that produce comparative data.\nTwo prosthetic valves-a tilting disc and a bileaflet valve-each sized 29 mm, were tested in the aortic position on two different pulse duplicators (PDs), namely the Dynatek MP1 and a system developed at the University of Sheffield. The common protocol adopted was the FDA Interlaboratory Comparison Testing Protocol. Original software was used to manage all test phases, thus minimizing operator-dependent variability in both systems and imposing strict control of experimental conditions. Statistical analysis performed on the data followed two approaches: (i) separate fitting of the two regression equations of pressure drop-flow rate relationship obtained for each valve on both PDs, and (ii) application of a multiple regression model, to fit a single regression equation of pressure drop-flow rate relationship, using data obtained from both PDs for each valve. In addition, an additional independent (dummy) variable was introduced.\nUsing this approach, the valve parameter range was obtained and, by imposing strict control of the experimental set-up, the coincidence of the two valve power laws, estimated by each of the two PDs, was studied.",

        "Of the various polymers used in medical devices, polyurethanes have been relatively successful because of their acceptable mechanical and biological properties. However, over the past decade, increasing concerns have arisen in relation to long-term biostability of polyurethanes when exposed to the harsh environment of the human body. Lysosomal enzymes released from inflammatory cells have been proposed to be important mediators in the degradation of biomedical polyurethanes. In order to increase the biostability of polyurethanes to lysosomal enzymes, a series of surface-modifying macromolecules (SMMs) were synthesized in this work and then combined into a base polyurethane to reduce the material's susceptibility to hydrolysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies showed that the SMMs were enriched within the upper 10 nm of the surface. In vitro biodegradation test results indicated that the degradation of a polyester-urea-urethane could be inhibited by the new SMM surface. It was also found that different SMM formulations provided varying degrees of inhibition against the biodegradation of the polyester-urea-urethane. Certain formulations of the SMMs were shown to be physically incompatible with the polyurethane and distorted surface morphology to the extent that biodegradation was enhanced.",

A manager, scientist, or engineer who is involved in development of this kind of innovative product may be helped by considering the impact of some of these decisions earlier in the process. Forewarned is fore-armed. The most basic design issue we faced was the conflict between the requirements we envisioned for the ultrasound simulator, and the limitations of realistic simulation.

However, this study suggests that it is safer to rely on audible rather than visual alarms when time-critical information such as oxygenation, heart beat and ventilator disconnection is concerned. Visual alarms would appear to be more appropriate for conveying less urgent information.",
        "This paper reports on the findings of an extensive survey investigating practising design engineers' perceptions of new product development within the UK medical device industry. The design activity recorded was predominantly the small-scale development of low volume products. Explicit formal procedures were rarely used in these small-scale developments of low volume products. Specific organizational and design process issues are identified by the respondents as key requirements for the success of the new product development process.",
        "Poly(etherurethane) elastomers are useful materials in medical devices because of their mechanical properties and biocompatibility. However, it is necessary to stabilize these elastomers against the oxidation of their ether soft segments. Synthetic antioxidants such as Santowhite and Irganox are often satisfactory; however, particularly for biomedical applications, it was of interest to test the natural antioxidant vitamin E in poly(etherurethane urea) (PEUU) elastomers in vivo. The alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E was added to PEUU at 5% by weight. Biaxially strained PEUU specimens with and without vitamin E were tested in vivo in the cage implant system. The influence of vitamin E on PEUU biostability was analyzed by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) characterization of the PEUU surface. ATR-FTIR results showed that vitamin E prevented chemical degradation of the PEUU surface up to 5 weeks implantation, and at 10 weeks 82% of the ether remained. In contrast, without an antioxidant, only 18% of the ether remained after 10 weeks. No surface pitting or cracking was observed by SEM on PEUU with vitamin E; PEUU without antioxidant ruptured owing to extensive pitting and cracking. It was concluded that the antioxidant properties of vitamin E prevented oxidation of strained PEUU elastomers in vivo. The influence of vitamin E on PEUU biocompatibility was characterized by exudate leukocyte counts, density of leukocytes adherent to the PEUU, and morphology of adherent leukocytes. These results indicated decreased leukocyte counts in the exudate and less active adherent cells on the PEUU with vitamin E compared to PEUU without antioxidant. A proposed cell-polymer feedback system demonstrates how vitamin E improves both biostability and biocompatibility of PEUU elastomers in vivo.",
        "The advancement of medical technology constantly demands the introduction of safer and more efficient medical instruments and devices. Recent litigation and rulings against the manufacturers of breast implants and the subsequent refusal of major plastic companies to supply materials to them are seriously threatening the production and development of other permanent implants such as ventricular assist devices and even disposable catheters. In addition, government overregulation also discourages and hinders production and clinical applications of new instruments. Current trends such as cost effectiveness measures and economic restraints imposed by government agencies and managed care systems are endangering investments from the medical and industrial communities to exploit more expensive and sophisticated instrument technologies. The resultant lack of grant money and pressure from animal rights advocates also suppress experimentation on primates and domestic laboratory animals.",

        "The implanted port vascular access system has provided many patients with safe and reliable vascular access. Its implanted design provides improved body image, reduced maintenance and a better quality of life. The Huber needle has been the standard means of accessing the implanted port system. Because of the problems associated with the Huber needle system, current standards recommend that the Huber needle be changed every 7 days. This evaluation examines the use of a polymer cannula to access the implanted port system. This polymer cannula eliminates many of the problems associated with the Huber needle and provides longer dwell times without increased complications. Seventy nine patients were accessed for a total of 1533 days with the mean dwell time being 19.4 days with no increase in complications associated with port access.\nTo establish implanted port access times of greater than 7 days without increased complications.\nA multicenter voluntary enrollment evaluation of a medical device.\nPatients were offered the opportunity to participate in the evaluation if they had an implanted port and were going to be accessed for therapy for periods of 7 days or more.\nPatients were observed for adverse cutaneous reactions at the insertion site and any port access complications such as sepsis, leakage, changes in portal chamber integrity, and implant pocket integrity.\nFrom October 1994 through November 1995, 79 L-Cath for Ports (Luther Medical Products) polymer catheter port access devices (Illustration 1) were inserted in 54 patients. This polymer port access device was used instead of a rigid metal Huber needle for port access. The total number of access days was 1533 days with the mean duration of access being 19.4 days. Two patients experienced blood stream infections while they were accessed with the polymer port access device. These infections ensued with fever of unknown origin as the presenting symptom during neutropenic episodes after chemotherapy treatment. The port access device was removed and the port access device tip was cultured with culture results being negative. No other patients experienced complications related to the port access device.\nThe polymer port access device provided a safe and effective means of extending port access times. This reduced the number of restarts for the patients and could extend portal septum life by exposing the portal septum to fewer accesses.",
        "Natural rubber latex sensitization is caused by proteins from the latex of Hevea brasiliensis, the Brazilian rubber tree. Alternative non-cross-reactive latex rubber sources are needed for the manufacture of nonallergenic medical devices (e.g., catheters) that require elasticity, which is not currently provided by synthetic materials.\nWe have studied the ability of IgE antibodies from subjects allergic to Hevea latex and IgG antibodies from hyperimmunized mice to detect proteins derived from guayule (Parthenium argentatum), an alternative rubber source, using a direct binding and competitive inhibition RAST and Western blot analysis.\nIgE antibodies from 62 subjects allergic to Hevea latex (46 adults and 16 children with spina bifida) and from serum pools of adults allergic to Hevea latex (n = 183), pediatric patients (n = 101), and patients with spina bifida (n = 53), as well as IgG antibodies from hyperimmunized mice, were unable to detect any proteins in guayule by RAST or Western blot analysis. No competitive inhibition of IgE anti-Hevea binding to Hevea solid phase was detected by the preincubation of sera from subjects allergic to Hevea latex with soluble guayule latex before RAST analysis.\nThese results demonstrate that proteins in guayule latex are not cross-reactive with Hevea latex allergens. Devices that require the elasticity provided by rubber may be manufactured with guayule latex as an alternative rubber source for patients with Hevea latex allergy.",
        "To establish a new method for evaluation of contact lens materials, we studied the porcine endothelial cell injury caused by dynamic contact (rotatory rubbing) with three kinds of hard contact lenses (HCL). The HCLs used were 1) PMMA HCL, 2) oxygen-permeable HCL composed of a graft copolymer of dextran derivative and methylmethacrylate (MMA) (Suncon Mild II, 12 Dk), and 3) oxygen-permeable-HCL composed of a copolymer of a monomer containing silicone, a monomer containing fluorine, and MMA (RGPL-A, 216 Dk). Cell injury rates were significantly different among these HCLs (Suncon Mild II < PMMA < RGPL-A) although there were no differences in rotatory rubbing forces. The smoothness of HCL surface, the qualities of injured cell layers observed by scanning electron microscopy, and the water wettability of HCLs were not correlated with cell injury rate. These results suggest that physicochemical properties of materials other than rotatory rubbing force, smoothness, and water wettability were involved in the cell injury. Our evaluation method for biomaterials that injure the corneal endothelial cells by dynamic contact should be very useful for the development of biomaterials or medical devices, including HCLs and intracardiac and urethral catheters.",

        "To compare the efficacy of the biofragmentable anastomotic ring (Valtrac-BAR, Davis and Geck, Medical Device Division, Danbury, CT, USA) with conventional anastomotic techniques, 30 patients who underwent colorectal surgery from August 1993 to March 1995 were retrospectively studied. The use of the BAR was also compared with conventional techniques including hand-sewn sutures in 30 patients and an end-to-end anastomosis (EEA) stapler in 24 patients. There were 17 men and 13 women in the BAR group with ages ranging from 37 to 80 years, 18 men and 12 women in the hand-sewn group with ages ranging from 41 to 82 years and 14 men and 10 women in the EEA group with ages ranging from 38 to 72 years. Surgical indications included: 25 colon cancers and five rectal cancers in the BAR group; 27 colon cancers and three rectal cancers in the hand-sewn group; and six colon cancers and 18 rectal cancers in the EEA group. There was no conversion to other anastomotic methods. Most of the patients tolerated a low-residual diet from the fifth post-operative day. No clinical leakage or stricture was noted. Only seven patients were aware of the passage of BAR fragments. The mean hospital stay was 14.1 days. There were no significant differences among these techniques in the return of bowel function, the incidence of surgical complications, including anastomotic leakage, or the length of hospitalization. BAR anastomosis was more time efficient than conventional techniques. Our results confirmed that BAR was an ideal sutureless alternative for anastomosis in colorectal surgery.",
        "The relatively limited variety of surfaces and geometries challenged in current sporicidal testing reduces the predictive value of these analyses when extrapolated to the wide variety of medical devices. The unknown spore load being challenged and the qualitative nature (growth/no growth) of those tests further prevent precise comparison among liquid chemical disinfectants. Hence, the relative activity of different chemical substances has not been clearly established, hindering selection of the best agent for each clinical situation.\nA micromethod was developed to assess sporicidal activity against Bacillus subtilis spores deposited on three different medical devices; carbon steel dental burs, silicone-rubber medical catheters, and titanium-alloy dental abutment screws. The spore load on each device and the recovery after three analytical steps were quantitatively assessed with spores radiolabeled with carbon 14 methionine.\nThe killing of 2 to 7 x 10(6) spores loaded on three different devices and exposed to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, copper ascorbate, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol for 30 minutes at 20 degrees C ranged from a 10(3)-fold decrease for 10% hydrogen peroxide to zero decrease for 5% phenol. Our results suggest that the nature of the surface being challenged may affect the sporicidal activity of some chemical agents.\nThe quantitative data presented allow comparison of the sporicidal effect of different liquid chemical agents. These findings may help prevent an overestimation of sporicidal activity and possible transmission of pathogens from the surface of improperly decontaminated medical devices.",
        "Surfaces of medical devices made of polymeric materials may promote thrombosis and inflammation. Therefore, in an attempt to produce surfaces which might diminish biomaterial-mediated thrombosis and inflammation, surface derivatization with 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonic acid (AMPS) was carried out. The derivatization procedure generates free radicals which initiate the copolymerization of AMPS monomers directly to a polyurethane surface. In an in vitro blood loop study using non-anticoagulated human blood, the resulting AMPS-derivatized material completely abrogates the generation of fibrinopeptide A, decreases the production of beta-thromboglobulin and C3a, and decreases the adherence of platelets. The derivatized material also attracts fewer adherent neutrophils when implanted in mice. However, AMPS derivatization unexpectedly increases the recruitment of macrophages to implanted material and promotes the formation of adherent sleeve thrombi on central venous catheters indwelling in non-anticoagulated canine femoral veins. Thus, AMPS derivatization has highly variable effects on inflammatory and thrombotic systems. Further investigation is clearly required to determine the mechanisms underlying both desired and adverse effects.",
        "In the last two years, scientific studies have confirmed that there is no significant increase in risk of subsequent breast cancer, connective-tissue disease or symptoms in women with silicone gel-filled breast implants. Despite this evidence, a moratorium (in place since 1992) on the use of these prostheses in the United States has been maintained by the pressure of overwhelming litigation. At the same time, Australian authorities also announced a moratorium, restricting the availability of silicone breast implants. Huge damages awarded by United States courts forced Dow Corning, manufacturer of a large percentage of breast prostheses, to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 1995. This effectively terminated the major source of implantable silicone for medical use. The withdrawal of implantable silicone and other implantable prosthetic material will be a significant loss for surgeons and society. This paper will highlight the consequences if reasoned scientific data are not relied on by Australian courts to assess claims for damages relating to medical devices.",

        "Two new technologies for use in the food industry are described. The first method discussed uses intense pulse of light. This pulsed light (PureBright) process uses short duration flashes of broad spectrum \"white\" light to kill all exposed microorganisms, including vegetative bacteria, microbial and fungal spores, viruses, and protozoan oocysts. Each pulse, or flash, of light lasts only a few hundred millionths of a second (i.e., a few hundred microseconds). The intensity of each flash of light is about 20,000 times the intensity of sunlight at the earth's surface. The flashes are typically applied at a rate of about one to tens of flashes per second. For most applications, a few flashes applied in a fraction of a second provide an effective treatment. High microbial kill can be achieved, for example, on the surfaces of packaging materials, on packaging and processing equipment, foods, and medical devices as well as on many other surfaces. In addition, some bulk materials such as water and air that allow penetration of the light can be sterilized. The results of tests to measure the effects of pulsed light on Salmonella enteritiditis on eggs are presented. The second method discussed uses multiple, short duration, high intensity electric field pulses to kill vegetative microorganisms in pumpable products. This pulsed electric field (or CoolPure) process can be applied at modest temperatures at which no appreciable thermal damage occurs and the original taste, color, texture, and functionality of products can be retained.",

        "In the controversy surrounding breast implants, one of the crucial questions is whether patients ca form antibodies directed against the silicone shell of the implant. If this were the case, implications for current breast implant development, indeed, for all silicone medical devices, are far-reaching. To evaluate this hypothesis, sera from 18 patients who had tissue expanders and 15 control patients who had no silicone implant exposure were tested retrospectively for antibodies to the silicone using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay previously documented as a case report in the literature. Contrary to previous studies, no significant difference in antibody levels was found between test subjects and the controls. Additionally, this enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for silicone antibodies was poorly reproducible. This study calls into question the existence of specific antibodies to the silicone shell. It also provides further data that the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay may not be reliable as a silicone antibody test.",

        "The advantages and limitations of automatic flexible endoscope reprocessors (AFERs) are presented. These medical devices can increase patient safety and minimize personnel exposure to the liquid chemical germicide and its vapors. Some models feature a printer to document important reprocessing parameters, an in-line tap water filtration system to reduce the likelihood of endoscope (and patient) contamination, and a heater to satisfy the elevated temperature requirements of some liquid chemical germicide labels. Although they offer significant advantages compared with manual reprocessing, AFERs have their limitations. Current models do not automate every endoscope reprocessing step and are not typically designed to reprocess every endoscope channel. Some AFER models may have to be periodically decontaminated to ensure that their internal components do not support microbial colonization. Moreover, their cost per cycle can be considerably more than manual reprocessing without necessarily reducing overall reprocessing time. Its limitations notwithstanding, an AFER is likely to be an asset in a busy endoscopy center. In addition to comparing automated and manual reprocessing, this article addresses important reprocessing issues and purchasing concerns.",

Twenty-nine children tried five chairs for up to 30 min in each; and a postal survey received 100 responses. The chairs seem to meet many users' postural needs (78% of postal survey; 31-72% of short-term evaluation depending on chair); the chairs' adjustability and availability of special features are important in meeting the needs of this user group; evidence of poor design and its implications are discussed.",
        "Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), the primary complaint of patients seen in sleep clinics, affects up to 12% of the general population. The effects of EDS can be debilitating and even life threatening. Patients with EDS may exhibit psychosocial distress, decreased work or school performance, and increased risk for accidents. The differential diagnosis of EDS requires objective assessments, such as polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. There are four major causes of EDS: (1) central nervous system (CNS) pathologic abnormalities, such as narcolepsy and idiopathic CNS hypersomnia; (2) qualitative or quantitative sleep deficiencies, such as sleep apnea and insufficient nocturnal sleep; (3) misalignments of the body's circadian pacemaker with the environment (eg. jet lag or shift work); and (4) drugs, which can increase sleepiness either therapeutically or as a side effect. Depending on etiology, management strategies for EDS include extension of time in bed, naps, surgery, various medical devices (eg, oral appliances, continuous positive airway pressure), and pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy is generally achieved with stimulants, such as amphetamine sulfate, methylphenidate, and pemoline or newer, safer compounds like modafinil.",

        "Clinical research into the efficacy and safety of antihypertensives has used non-invasive automated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) for the last two decades. Different national validation requirements have standardized the equip;ment and the clinical use thereof. The European Standardization for Medical Devices (CEN/CENELEC) organization has recently approved requirements for new ABPM devices in most European countries. For the approval process of new antihypertensive drugs, ABPM today has a supportive role to play in the documentation. Increasingly, national regulatory bureaux demand ABPM data. For the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ABPM is still not a prerequisite for approval but the value of peak: trough evaluation has recently been debated by major advisory boards. A US-based Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) has been established to evaluate ABPM data from controlled trials with versus without placebo controls. In major clinical trials it has been documented that the ABPM technique reduces sample size, reduces the number of placebo-controlled trials, provides detailed information concerning the first-dose effect, documents the duration of action and dose-response relationship and allows documentation of antihypertensive therapy throughout 24 h, including the night-time period.

        "Filtered exhaust helmets (space suits) have been reported as efficacious in decreasing wound infections following joint arthroplasty procedures; however, strict experimental control of the many variables related to the incidence of clinical infection has been lacking in these studies, making support of such conclusions difficult. Any potential benefit of filtered exhaust helmets in the control of infection rates can be logically assigned to the reduction of airborne bacterial counts within the operating room. A study was done using the Steri-Shield helmet (Bio-Medical Devices, Irvine, CA) to define its efficacy in limiting airborne bacterial contaminates during total joint arthroplasty. Forty-eight paired prosthetic hip and knee cases were evaluated using a block experimentation design. One case of each pair was done with all surgical and scrub personnel cloaked in Steri-Shield filtered exhaust helmets and the other with the same personnel in conventional paper hoods and masks. Air samples were obtained with an Anderson two-stage viable particle sampler (Anderson Samplers, Atlanta, GA) placed immediately adjacent to the wound. Quantitative microbial cultures were obtained. The filtered exhaust helmet evaluated in this study provided no increased protection against bacterial contamination in the area of the surgical field than conventional paper hoods and masks.",
        "Health care workers and individuals with frequent contact with latex are at risk for latex protein allergy.\nThe purpose of this study was to compare several established methods for measuring protein in extracts from latex-containing medical devices.\nExtracts from latex gloves were analyzed for natural rubber proteins using a modified Lowry assay and two different immunochemical assays. The immunochemical methods were competitive inhibition assays that employed either immune rabbit serum or human serum with antibodies directed against natural rubber proteins.\nSeventy extracts representing five different brands of gloves from four manufacturers were analyzed. A good linear correlation (R = 0.88) was found between the immunoassay methods. Correlation to the modified Lowry method was not possible because many of the samples were below the limit of detection for the Lowry assay. Reference extracts and antisera were further characterized by Western blot analysis. The data demonstrate that the proteins recognized by rabbit antisera and the proteins recognized by human IgE are similar. The greatest difference in the immunochemical assays appears to be the relative binding of the antibody sources to high and low molecular weight natural rubber proteins in the reference extracts.\nThe immunochemical assays are specific for latex proteins and provide a more sensitive and biologically relevant method for determining protein levels in latex medical products.",

Reuse occurred in 64 (38%), and another 33 hospitals had been reusing medical devices 12 months before our survey (i.e., 97/168 hospitals [58%] were either reusing them at the time of our survey or had been doing so 12 months previously). More large (> 300 beds) metropolitan public hospitals (9/14; 64%) reported reusing than did smaller (50/143; 41%) or private hospitals (15/47; 32%). At six of the 64 hospitals where reuse occurred, the process of cleaning and/or sterilization of these devices was not satisfactory; from the information we received, both cleaning and sterilization were satisfactory in only 38 hospitals (59%). Examination of the 14 most commonly reuse devices showed that the structure of 13 of these may compromise cleaning (and therefore sterilization). The main reason given for reuse was cost saving. Assuming a 2% prevalence of transmissible infections in blood, and an infection transmission risk of 1/500, we estimate that each year in Australia there may be 40 cases of cross-infection for every one million procedures performed with reused devices (0.004%).\nReuse of medical devices labelled \"single use only\" is common in Australian hospitals. Most devices appear to be unsuitable for reuse.

It is in the public interest that commercial kits are of high quality.\nTo review the current situation of kit evaluation in Europe and to establish practical and sensible criteria for kit evaluation in general, based on the Swiss experience with the licencing of kits for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Kit evaluation should provide the user with a selection of sufficiently good products. In addition, it should be simple and not require rare patient materials. Also of importance is that all manufacturers are treated equally.\nThe evaluation criteria depend on the legal situation, the intended use of the test, the state of the art and the graveness of false-negative or -positive results. In addition to diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, other important considerations include the quality control by the manufacturer, kit presentation, intra- and inter-lot reproducibility and how a test fits into a country's adopted testing system.\nThe above goals can be achieved by setting minimal performance standards, preferably in the form of a lower limit of the confidence interval for the sensitivity/specificity that has been observed in the test's field evaluation. The better the test, the fewer samples have to be studied. For tests with no false results observed during field trials, the minimum sample number necessary for demonstration of a sensitivity or specificity >/= 99% is about 400, while it is 700 for a >/= 99.5% demonstration. Further insight into sensitivity is provided by results from well described and frequently used commercial seroconversion panels. This represents a dynamic tool that readily identifies insensitive kits that have become technically obsolete. Specificity assessment should not only involve blood donors, but also appropriate clinical controls. It is clear that the test design has an important bearing with respect to sensitivity and specificity. There are inherent advantages and disadvantages of indirect binding assays, capture assays and double antigen sandwich assays. Positive or negative results with these different test formats may not carry exactly the same message.\nEfficient kit evaluation does not require tens of thousands of samples but can be performed with relatively little disbursement on materials and manpower.",
        "Testing for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) in the clinical environment introduces a host of complex conditions not normally encountered under laboratory conditions. In the clinical environment, various radio-frequency (RF) sources of electromagnetic interference (EMI) may be present throughout the entire spectrum of interest. Isolating and analyzing the impact from the sources of interference to medical devices involves a multidisciplinary approach based on training in, and knowledge of, the following: operation of medical devices and their susceptibility to EMI; RF propagation modalities and interaction theory; spectrum analysis systems and techniques (preferably with signature analysis capabilities) and calibrated antennas; the investigation methodology of suspected EMC problems, and testing protocols and standards. Using combinations of standard test procedures adapted for the clinical environment with personnel that have an understanding of radio-frequency behavior increases the probability of controlling, proactively, EMI in the clinical environment, thus providing for a safe and more effective patient care environment.",
        "The nose and not the mouth should be used for breathing as the nose has better air conditioning capacity. When air is inhaled through the mouth it may dry and cool the respiratory mucosa, which can lead to bronchoconstriction in sensitive patients with asthma. By dilating the nostrils you can increase nasal breathing in most subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sleeping with dilated nostrils reduces nocturnal asthma. At the Asthma and Allergy Research Centre, Gothenburg, 15 out-patients with nocturnal asthma were selected. Every other night for 10 nights the test subjects slept with the nasal dilator Nozovent which has been shown to increase the nasal air-flow and decrease the need for mouthbreathing. Every morning the patients self-reported on a form whether they had woken with asthma during the night or if they had had to take asthma medication. When sleeping with the nasal dilator the patients woke up with asthma on 17 of 75 nights as compared with 32 of 75 when sleeping without the device (p < 0.01). Reduced nocturnal asthma was observed by 12 patients and less need for asthma medication at night by 7. None of the patients noted any side-effects due to the device. In conclusion, the easy-to-use and cheap medical device, Nozovent, which mechanically dilates the nostrils and improves nasal breathing, can reduce nocturnal asthma.",
        "This case study presents an industry perspective on medical innovation. Introduced as a scientific breakthrough in the late 1970s, transcutaneous oxygen monitoring was rapidly adopted for routine use in neonatal intensive care. But plagued by technical problems, it was within a decade being replaced by pulse oximetry, a still more recent technology. Its use in efforts to prevent retinopathy of prematurity, an eye disease of preterm newborns often leading to blindness, proved disappointing. The project included interviews with executives and design engineers of companies marketing the device, with investigators who had pioneered the technology, and with senior practicing neonatologists. The findings, reflecting complexity and uncertainty, are relevant to issues concerning health care in the United States and other developed nations. They centre on the key role and ultimate responsibility of the medical profession, with a need for greater attention to the scientific training of health care workers, as perceived by members of the medical device industry. The views of senior investigators are integrated into the picture, with discussion of major challenges faced by the medical community.",
        "Cell adhesion plays an important role in several cell processes and functions, including differentiation, proliferation and death. An important role for cell attachment to medical devices in biocompatibility studies has also been hypothesized. In this paper we report that the use of the antioxidant drug N-acetyl-cysteine is capable of increasing the adhesion properties of epithelial cells in culture. This is associated with a modification of specific cytoskeletal element assembly, such as microfilament system molecules. In contrast, no quantitative alterations in the expression of certain surface receptors for extracellular matrix molecules, such as VLA2, VLA3 and VLA6, are found. These data seem to indicate that intracellular oxidative balance, in particular of thiol groups, could play a key role in the cell adhesion properties and that N-acetyl-cysteine treatment, acting as 'thiol supply', could be of importance in several circumstances, including biocompatibility of medical devices.",

        "Because latex products are essential in preventing the transmission of blood-borne diseases, reports of severe, immediate allergic reactions to latex exposure have become a major public health concern. In recent years, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions to latex have been reported with increasing frequency and have been associated with anaphylaxis and death. The most severe reactions have been reported in the health care setting. Three groups appear to be at highest risk: children with spina bifida or with a history of multiple surgeries, workers with industrial exposure to latex and health care workers. This review presents the scope of this problem in the various risk groups, the different techniques available for diagnosis and the consensus on principles of management. Because latex is a component of many commonly used medical devices, including surgical and examination gloves, it behooves us to identify latex-sensitive patients and be prepared to treat allergic reactions promptly.",
        "In theory, setting an infrared multi-gas analyser to measure a volatile anaesthetic different from that in the sampled gas mixture may cause interference with carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide readings. The theory was investigated during evaluation of the Dr\u00e4ger Cicero EM anaesthetic workstation for the Medical Devices Agency. Interference occurred as predicted, and was most pronounced when the vapour analyser of the Cicero EM was deliberately and erroneously set to measure isoflurane, but with sevoflurane present in the gas mixture. With 6% sevoflurane in the gas mixture, the carbon dioxide reading decreased from 5% to 3.6%, and the nitrous oxide reading increased from 0% to 8% although, as the apparent isoflurane reading was 9%, the Cicero EM would alert the operator to the problem. However, operators are encouraged to ensure that, when using gas analysers such as that incorporated into the Cicero EM, the analyser is set to measure the correct volatile anaesthetic (the Cicero EM does this automatically when a Vapor vaporizer is attached) and the breathing system does not contain any other volatile anaesthetic agents.",
        "Liver failure, especially in its acute form, is a medical emergency that quickly leads to failure of multiple other organs. Many of these end-organ failures can be supported temporarily by drugs or medical devices, but the support is invariably short-lived if liver function is not restored. In most instances, liver function can only be restored by transplantation, although patients with acute disease have the potential to recover by regeneration (\"spontaneous recovery\"). Unfortunately, spontaneous recovery from acute liver failure is uncommon, so the two most important aspects of patient management are highly skilled intensive care and early recognition of patients in need of liver transplantation. Even under these circumstances, the mortality of liver failure remains high because we have no easy way of replacing liver function on demand and donor organs are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in time. The development of techniques for liver assist offer the possibility that patients with liver failure will become a simple management problem, analogous to the options available in the treatment of acute and chronic renal failure.",

        "Vascular grafts, devices designed to augment inefficiently functioning vascular systems, represent a significant part of implantable medical devices, with major participation in over a million vascular surgeries performed worldwide. By definition accepted in the art, a small caliber graft is a conduit with internal diameter (ID) of 6 mm or less; large caliber grafts start at ID of 7 mm. While the autologous grafts utilizing saphenous veins (SVG) and internal iliac, or mammary arteries are used exclusively in cardiac artery bypass grafts (CABG) procedures and preferentially in many peripheral indications, and while the use of grafts with biological origin did not proliferate, polymer-based artificial grafts of controlled patterns and porosity are prostheses of choice for the large caliber. The polyester (PET) yarn is knitted or woven into various porous patterns. The PTFE tubes are expanded into porous conduits (ePTFE). Although these technologies are used to produce the grafts with ID larger than 6 mm, the dominant principles are being applied to the development of small caliber graft. Polyurethanes are also evaluated for small caliber application. The grafts (regardless of the ID) produced by the above technologies are porous. This porosity, considered to be critical for proper healing and overall graft patency, causes the blood to leak through the graft wall or at anastomosis through the suture holes. Both the wall leakage and suture hole bleeding remain rather serious drawbacks. Currently, collagen, gelatin, albumin and their derivatives are used as sealants. Various modes of application and degrees of crosslinking are utilized to control in vivo degradation and graft healing. Other hydrogels, both natural and synthetic, could play significant roles as sealants and modifiers of the graft performance. Enhancement of graft patency via improvement of initial hemocompatibility could be achieved by application of bioactive coatings. Heparinized systems seem to dominate in this field, but many new concepts are being investigated. Intraluminal endothelialization via mediating biologicals could open significant potential for synthetic small caliber grafts. Furthermore, porous biodegradable tubes could be used as temporary scaffold to attract and promote cell propagation and ingrowth, the true angiogenesis. Part I of this series discusses the \"S.O.T.A\" of the small caliber graft. The following parts will discuss concepts needed for development of truly patent small caliber grafts and will report on our progress in the development of biodurable and pulsatile grafts for vascular access, peripheral, and potentially for CABG indications.",
        "The regulatory policy of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on radiopharmaceuticals flows from a rigid, traditional, drug-like interpretation of the FDC Act on the licensing of radiopharmaceuticals. This contributes to significant delays in the drug-approval process for radiopharmaceuticals, which are very costly to the nuclear medicine community and the American public. It seems that radiopharmaceuticals would be better characterized as molecular devices. Good generic rule-making principles include: use of a risk/benefit/cost analysis; intent based on sound science; performance standards prepared by outside experts; a definite need shown by the regulatory agency; to live with the consequences of any erroneous cost estimates; and design individual credential requirements so that additional training results in enhanced professional responsibility. When these common elements are applied to current FDA policy, it seems that the agency is out of sync with the stated goals for revitalizing federal regulatory policies as deemed necessary by the Clinton administration. Recent FDA rulings on positron-emission tomography, Patient Package inserts, and on medical device service accentuate the degree of such asynchronization. Radiopharmaceutical review and licensing flexibility could be dramatically improved by excluding radiopharmaceuticals from the drug category and reviewing them as separate entities. This new category would take into account their excellent record of safety and their lack of pharmacological action. Additionally, their evaluation of efficacy should be based on their ability to provide useful scintiphotos, data, or responses of the physiological system it portends to image, quantitate, or describe. To accomplish the goal of transforming the FDA's rigid, prescriptive policy into a streamlined flexible performance-based policy, the Council on Radionuclides and Radiopharmaceuticals proposal has been presented. In addition, it is suggested that the United States Pharmacopeia write radiopharmaceutical review standards, that an independent scientific body review the data submitted, and that the FDA either accept or reject the recommendation.",

        "The frequent inflammatory responses to implanted medical devices are puzzling in view of the inert and nontoxic nature of most biomaterials. Because implant surfaces spontaneously adsorb host proteins, this proteinaceous film is probably important in the subsequent attraction of phagocytes. In fact, earlier we found that acute inflammatory responses to experimental polyethylene terephthalate implants in mice require the precedent adsorption of one particular host protein, fibrinogen. The present investigations were aimed at defining the molecular determinants of fibrinogen-mediated acute inflammatory responses to implanted biomaterials. We find: (a) plasmin degradation of purified fibrinogen into defined domains reveals that the proinflammatory activity resides within the D fragment, which contains neither the fibrin cross-linking sites nor RGD sequences; (b) the major (and, perhaps, exclusive) proinflammatory sequence appears to be fibrinogen gamma 190-202, previously shown to interact with CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1). The chemically synthesized peptide, cross-linked to albumin (which itself does not promote inflammatory responses), mimics the proinflammatory effect of adsorbed native fibrinogen; and (c) this sequence probably promotes inflammatory responses through interactions with Mac-1 because phagocyte accumulation on experimental implants is almost completely abrogated by administration of recombinant neutrophil inhibitory factor (which blocks CD11b-fibrin(ogen) interaction). We conclude that improved knowledge of such surface-protein-phagocyte interactions may permit the future development of more biocompatible implantable materials.",

Results of a cross-sectional survey of registered nurses (n = 238) working at a large South Australian tertiary care centre on units with high usage both of indwelling urethral (Foley) catheters and intravenous infusion pumps revealed that participants were significantly more likely to have learned to use the indwelling urethral (Foley) catheter in nursing school than they were to have learned how to use an intravenous infusion pump.  Participants differed significantly on most (13 of 17) items about what they learned, with nurses being more likely to learn various factors about the indwelling urethral catheter than the infusion pump. Registered nurses were more likely to feel stressed when using an intravenous infusion pump than when using an indwelling urethral catheter, but were more likely to have used an indwelling urethral catheter that caused a patient harm than an intravenous infusion pump that caused a patient harm.  The most frequently identified reasons for incidents of patient harm resulting from use of an intravenous infusion pump were user error and inadequate device education.

        "A distinguishing feature of American health care is its emphasis on advanced technology. Yet today's changing health care environment is overhauling the engine of technological innovation. The rate and direction of technological innovation are affected by a complex of supply- and demandside factors, including biomedical research, education, patent law, regulation, health care payment, tort law, and more. Some distinguishing features of technological innovation in health care are now at increased risk. Regulatory requirements and rising payment hurdles are especially challenging to small technology companies. Closer management of health care delivery and payment, particularly the standardization that may derive from practice guidelines and clamping down on payment for investigational technologies, curtails opportunities for innovation. Levels and distribution of biomedical research funding in government and industry are changing. Financial constraints are limiting the traditional roles of academic health centers in fostering innovation. Despite notable steps in recent years to lower regulatory barriers and speed approvals, especially for products for life-threatening conditions, the Food and Drug Administration is under great pressure from Congress, industry, and patients to do more. Technology gatekeeping is shifting from hundreds of thousands of physicians acting on behalf of their patients to fewer, yet more powerful, managed care organizations and health care networks. Beyond its direct effects on adoption, payment, and use of technologies, the extraordinary buying leverage of these large providers is cutting technology profit margins and heightening competition among technology companies. It is contributing to unprecedented restructuring of the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, leading to unprecedented alliances with generic product companies, health care providers, utilization review companies, and other agents. These industry changes are already having considerable effects on investment patterns and the development, adoption, and use of new technologies. Until recently, new technologies that offered the prospect for health benefit, however, marginal or unproven, were paid for with little or no regard to cost. Technical wizardry alone no longer carries the day in health care. Today's health care market increasingly demands what other markets do--measurable improvements in benefits at acceptable costs--and innovators have begun to respond accordingly. Even so, certain key venues for health care innovation are at risk.",

        "Nitrogen implantation and thermal nitridation processes are investigated to improve the wear resistance of titanium medical devices. Ion implantation uses 80 keV nitrogen ions and doses ranging between 1 x 10(17) and 5 x 10(17)/cm2 to modify the surface layers up to 140 nm depth. Stable surface layers are obtained at high ion doses by post-annealing at 550 degrees C for 30 min. Thermal processes are developed as a function of the time (20-90 min) and annealing temperature (950-1100 degrees C) in a dry nitrogen atmosphere. The amount of titanium nitride formed during the thermal process increases with the annealing temperature and time. Samples are analysed by Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Ion implantation and thermal nitridation processes increase the surface hardness and wear resistance improving the mechanical properties of titanium used for movable devices for total joint replacements, such as the hip and knee protheses.",
        "NiTi shape Memory Alloys (SMA) are potential biomaterial candidates for medical devices such as osteosynthesis staples. However, Ni dissolution induced by uniform or localized corrosion could lead to toxicity. In this work, plasma polymerized tetrafluoroethylene (PPFTE) coating is used to improve the corrosion resistance of NiTi plates and corresponding NiTi stables. The scratch test indicates a good surface adhesion of the film but that it lacks cohesiveness. Potentiodynamic tests in physiological Hank's solution show that PPTFE coating improved the pitting corrosion resistance. The passivation range is increased from 35% to 96% compared to the untreated sample and the pit diameter is decreased from 100 microns to 10 microns. The uniformity of the deposited film is a very important parameter. When the film is damaged, the corrosion seems to increase in comparison to the untreated samples. Otherwise, if the staple is carefully manipulated, the coating follows the large deformations induced by the memory effect of the alloy without cracking, and then, protects efficiently the staple from pitting.",

        "Although significant progress has been made in the design of blood-compatible polymers in the past decades, there is no ideal polymer surface which is comparable with a natural endothelial surface in preventing surface-induced thrombosis and maintaining hemostasis. This is due to the complex pattern of protein and cellular interactions with foreign surfaces, which still demands defining a proven hypothesis to develop non-thrombogenic surfaces. Synthesis of new polymers with optimal mechanical properties and the in vitro and in vivo characterization of these surfaces will require many more years of work. In this article, the surface modification of existing medical polymers for the improvement of blood compatibility is introduced. Surface immobilizing of heparin onto polyurethane, coatings of a polyurethane-poly(ethylene oxide)-heparin graft copolymer, and a coating of thermosensitive polymers on polyurethane will be discussed. All modified surfaces demonstrated superior blood compatibility both in vitro and in vivo. The biological response of these designed systems in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo should provide state-of-the-art materials for the specific application of controlling thrombosis and solving biocompatibility problems.",
        "Several biologic-biomaterial combinations are currently under development in an attempt to modulate tissue or organ function in patients. The FDA regulations on combination products and the intercenter agreements among the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), and the Center for Drugs Evaluation and Research (CDER) provide further guidance on center jurisdiction of combination products and other products where there are jurisdictional concerns. The biological component of biologic-biomaterial combinations raises a number of issues that relate to the safety and bioactivity of the final product. For example, transmission of adventitious agents to patients via somatic cells, tissue, or cell-derived products is a major safety concern as are in vivo inflammatory responses elicited by the biomaterial component. CBER has drafted a number of \"Points to Consider\" documents to provide further guidance in the development of biological products. The intent of this article is to provide the highlights of the FDA regulations for combination products and the intercenter agreement between CBER and CDRH delineating the responsibilities of each center for medical device activities. In addition, the article focuses on the CBER's concerns related to the development of somatic cell-biomaterial combinations for therapeutic use.",
        "The goal of this study is to determine the relationship between transient changes in total oxidizable carbon concentration (TOC), bacterial numbers, and endotoxin concentrations at several serial unit operations in a high purity water system. Bacteria are a dynamic component of any ambient temperature sections in a high purity water system; they are living and growing inhabitants. Their numerical variability over time poses challenging QA/QC problems for many industries using high purity waters for manufacturing, formulation, equipment rinsing, and medical device preparation. Preliminary data (Husted et al., 1994) suggested that a possible relationship existed between spontaneous transient elevations in TOC concentration and total planktonic (free floating) bacterial numbers in high purity waters: rising TOC produced sudden increases in bacterial concentration. If the results collected earlier are reproducible, real time monitoring of TOC stability may offer a gateway measurement permitting estimation of changes in endotoxin and bacterial cell concentration, analyses currently made off line in the laboratory. This correlation would also supply guidance for system operation to produce water with both an enhanced and a reproducible quality.",
        "Explanted medical devices are routinely sent to laboratories at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health for analysis. The shipping of these devices presents potential hazards to personnel as well as an opportunity for damage to the devices. In an effort to address these concerns, a viscous disinfecting shipping medium that would limit splashing and cushion a suspended device was proposed. Consequently, we investigated the disinfectant properties of adding a gelling agent, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) to common disinfectants. We found that the germicidal effectiveness of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M borax when tested against Bacillus subtilis spores was not changed by the addition of 2% HPMC. In addition, HPMC appears to be compatible with 70% ethanol and at least one commercial disinfectant containing a quaternary ammonium compound. Preliminary experiments indicate that an HPMC-disinfectant gel is a potentially useful packaging agent for minimizing the hazards to personnel and materials during shipping of explanted medical devices. The use of such a medium would be subject to guidelines within the context of a program for handling biologically contaminated materials.",

        "Dramatic changes in the epidemiology and susceptibility patterns of Gram-positive cocci during the last decade have mandated new approaches to the management of many bacterial infections. For example, there has been a sharp increase in the incidence of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, particularly those resistant to methicillin (MRSA), and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly those associated with foreign bodies and indwelling medical devices. Additionally, the worldwide spread of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to penicillin and macrolides, and the emergence of enterococci (particularly Enterococcus faecium) resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and other antibiotics, present further therapeutic problems. New antibacterial agents are urgently required to meet the challenges posed by these epidemiological trends. The semisynthetic streptogramins, a unique class of antibacterials currently under development, offer promise in the treatment of such multiresistant infections. Possible future applications include treatment of infections caused by the following organisms: MRSA, enterococci resistant to vancomycin, macrolides or lincosamides; and beta-lactam-resistant streptococci. They may also prove useful as therapy for children with staphylococcal infection and patients with multiresistant infections who are unable to tolerate vancomycin, including patients with skin and soft tissue infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, patients with osteomyelitis, foreign body associated infections, endocarditis and sepsis due to Gram-positive bacteria. Clinical trials are required to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of streptogramins in these settings.",

Drawing on a review of the secondary literature and on-going field work, the evidence suggests that the current mix of state-centric and self-regulatory traditions will be as important in determining the implementation and final outcomes of EU-rules as the new rules themselves. EU directives redesign rules, but they do not necessarily lead to institutional change, create manpower, skills and institutional capacities, or alter governance and administrative practices in the short term.

        "Robots designed for surgery have three main advantages over humans. They have greater three dimensional spatial accuracy, are more reliable, and can achieve much greater precision. Although few surgical robots are yet in clinical trials one or two have advanced to the stage of seeking approval from the UK's Medical Devices Agency and the US Federal Drug Administration. Safety is a key concern. A robotic device can be designed in an intrinsically safe way by restricting its range of movement to an area where it can do no damage. Furthermore, safety can be increased by making it passive, guided at all times by a surgeon. Nevertheless, some of the most promising developments may come from robots that are active (monitored rather than controlled by the surgeon) and not limited to intrinsically safe motion.",

        "Catheter-related infections are major problems in medicine because of severe consequences for the patient, prolongation of hospitalization, and increasing therapy costs. Beside progress in hygienic measures, development of catheters with antiinfective properties seems to be a promising approach to the prevention of such infections. Two approaches for infection-resistant catheter materials have been developed: materials with antiadhesive properties and materials with antimicrobial properties. Antiadhesive polymers shall prevent the adhesion of microorganisms to the medical device. However, up to now there has been no material which would lead to a complete inhibition of adherence (\"zero adherence\"). Materials with antimicrobial properties contain antimicrobial substances which are incorporated into the biomaterial or bound to the polymer surface. These devices seem to be effective in the prevention of \"early onset infections\". In this paper, an overview of the development and efficiency of antiadhesive or antimicrobial polymers is given.",
        "Infections represent a complication after transient or permanent implantation of medical devices (e.g. catheters or pacemaker systems), leading in many cases to therapeutic consequences such as the removal of the implanted system. Diagnosis of foreign body infections is difficult and mainly based on clinical findings rather than laboratory methods or modern morphological imaging tools. Two-dimensional echocardiography by transthoracic and transesophageal approach may be helpful in the detection of vegetations, but is not very sensitive for infections. Most methods in nuclear medicine, however, are based on function and not on form: some methods for the detection of an infection are unspecific like the use of labelled nanocolloids or Ga-67-citrate, or they need time-consuming and susceptible techniques for the labelling of autologous leukocytes. Monoclonal antibodies against epitopes on granulocytes, however, offer a fast and reliable in-vivo labelling technique. It has been demonstrated in a group of four patients that scintigraphic detection of pacemaker infections by immunoscintigraphy may represent a valuable diagnostic tool.",

The guidance may be applied to medical and surgical units within hospitals (e.g. ITU, renal dialysis units, casualty) as well as general practitioners' surgeries, for blood counts and coagulation testing. The professional head of the central laboratory must take responsibility for all aspects of the NPT service, although there should be full discussion with the clinical departments involved and joint ownership of the results. NPT operators must be trained and accredited by the central laboratory. Equipment selected should normally have received a satisfactory evaluation report from the Medical Devices Agency (MDA), and should generate results that are comparable with those of the central laboratory. If a full MDA operation evaluation has not been performed, the purchaser should perform a local assessment according to the protocol in this document. The suitability of the equipment, imprecision, and comparability must be studied. The NPT equipment must be properly maintained and calibrated, and a record of patient identity, date and time of testing, reagent lot numbers, and operator must be kept.

The modification of medical equipment into weapons by incarcerated patients, although clearly recognized as a security and safety problem by police authorities, appears to be unappreciated by health care workers providing episodic care to inmates.",
        "Despite emerging evidence about the high incidence and severity of wheelchair-related injuries, regulations governing wheelchair safety are almost nonexistent in Canada. The authors believe that, to improve wheelchair safety, a concerted effort by government, manufacturers, purchasing groups, users and clinicians is needed. Health Canada's Health Protection Branch should treat wheelchairs as medical devices (as defined in the Food and Drugs Act 1985) and improve its injury-reporting network. Manufacturers should give a higher priority to safety in wheelchair design, improve their educational materials and formalize postmarketing surveillance. Purchasing groups should try to ensure that they do not stifle innovation in wheelchair design by setting unrealistic reimbursement ceilings and should use their market power more effectively. Users should obtain their wheelchairs in specialized settings, heed safety warnings and make more effective use of litigation when such action is warranted. Clinicians should ensure that patients are equipped with the most appropriate wheelchair for their needs, that they are given adequate training in safe wheelchair use and that they understand the dangers involved. Rapid changes in wheelchair technology and emerging evidence about the high incidence and severity of injuries related to wheelchair use suggest that such changes are needed in the wheelchair delivery system.",

        "This article reports the production of a surgical implant meeting several specific requirements such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, macroporosity, and flexibility. Porosity was controlled by an original method consisting of the aggregation of calibrated poly-D,L-lactide microparticles. The size of the interstices between the aggregated microspheres was in a direct relationship to the microsphere diameter. A first approach was based on coating the microspheres with poly(vinyl alcohol) followed by chemically crosslinking the coating layers that were in mutual contact. This method was disregarded because of the acute cytotoxicity of glutaraldehyde used as the crosslinking agent, the absence of macroporosity, and the complete lack of flexibility. A physical technique of aggregation was then tested, which relied on the plasticization of poly-D,L-lactide microspheres with triethylcitrate to the point where microspheres strongly adhered to each other when they were in contact. This method has proved to be straightforward and definitely superior to the chemical approach, particularly with respect to cytotoxicity, control of macroporosity, and flexibility. A polymer support was thus successfully which was biodegradable, macroporous( interconnected pores of 10-100 microns in diameter), and flexible. This potential medical device is presently being used for neuronal transplantation in the central nervous system.",
        "Using data generated in the course of an evaluation program for hemodialyzers and associated devices, which was supported by the Medical Devices Agency of the Department of Health, we have compared the performance characteristics of 23 hemodialyzers evaluated 20 years ago with those of 18 hemodialyzers evaluated during 1993-1994. Surface areas of the two groups ranged from 0.6-2.5 m2 (mean 1.13 m2) and 0.6-1.8 m2 (mean 1.18 m2), respectively. The device performance has been compared both in vivo (small molecular clearance) and in vitro (middle molecular clearance and ultrafiltration coefficient) at blood and dialysate flows of 200 and 500 ml/min, respectively. Our comparison shows that over the past 2 decades there has been a marked improvement in functional performance. For clearance of small molecules, current dialyzers using cellulose-based membranes offer a 47% improvement for urea clearance, within the surface area range < 1.2 m2, while for dialyzers whose surface area is > 1.2 m2 the improvement is less marked (12%). The improvements noted in the clearance of creatinine were similar. Associated with the improved clearance of small molecules was an improved middle molecular clearance (74% for surface areas < 1.2 m2 and 63% for surface areas > 1.2 m2) and an increased ultrafiltration coefficient, higher by 154 and 133%, respectively, for the two surface area groups. Due to the smaller number of devices in the modified cellulose and synthetic membrane categories, it has not been possible to make such a detailed comparison. However, the experimental data demonstrate that devices currently produced incorporating modified cellulose and synthetic membranes overlap in performance and that in those devices that were in clinical use 20 years ago using synthetic membranes, current equivalents have also improved. These improvements are reflected in the concomitant reduction of treatment times from 30 h/week in 1970 to 12 h or less currently.",

The participants were significantly more likely to have learned to use the indwelling urethral catheter in nursing school than they were to have learned how to use an intravenous infusion pump in nursing school. Staff nurses differed significantly on most (12 of 17) items about what they had learned and were more likely to have learned about various features of the indwelling urethral catheter than about the infusion pump. The participants were significantly more likely to feel stressed when using an intravenous infusion pump than when using an indwelling urethral catheter, but were significantly more likely to have used an indwelling urethral catheter that caused a patient harm than an intravenous infusion pump that caused a patient harm.",
        "John Abele, Founder Chairman of Boston Scientific Corporation, spoke at AAMI's 30th Annual Meeting on 22 May in Anaheim, CA. His speech was part of AAMI's plenary session, \"The Impact of a Reformed Health System on New Technology.\" After his speech, Abele joined three of AAMI's experts in a roundtable discussion on the topics he raised. See the BI&T Forum page 479 for their discussion. As a business entrepreneur and scientist, Abele is well versed in the topic of health reform and scientific advancements. He began his career with a degree in physics and philosophy, then moved into the health care field because of his fascination with medical devices and technologies. He has spent years working as an engineer, a salesperson, a general manager, and a partner in a research and development company. He was a cofounder of AAMI in 1965. Boston Scientific's roots trace back to 1969, when Abele joined with Itzhak Bentov to build a company around a steerable catheter. The associated technology became a platform for many types of tools that could be used as alternatives to surgery in most organs of the body. Today, with over 5,000 employees, 4,000 products, and a worldwide presence, the original objective of developing products and procedures that reduce risk, trauma, cost, and time still applies. Abele is the author of many papers and book chapters, and he has lectured extensively on the technology of various medical devices and technical, social, economic, and political trends affecting health care. His major interests are science education and the process by which new technology is invented, developed, and introduced to society. The following article is based on Abele's presentation.",

        "More people die in the United States each day of potentially reversible VF than of any other cause of death, reversible or not. Early defibrillation is the definitive treatment. Automated external defibrillation is a proven technology now confirmed to have saved thousands of lives. As with all medical devices and technology, perfection is not possible. Some problems, such as those represented by the two cases discussed in this article, are inevitable and acceptable and give little cause for alarm. One would not stop penicillin from being manufactured and distributed because of a sudden, unexpected allergic reaction in one patient (error of commission) or an unexpected resistant organism in another (error of omission). The FDA must understand that AEDs, even if they are imperfect, are not anywhere near as dangerous as no defibrillator at all. AEDs have finally allowed many EMS systems to achieve early defibrillation. Discontinuing use of AEDs or closing AED manufacturers could mean a significant number of lives lost unnecessarily. Therefore EMS agencies planning to implement early-defibrillation programs should continue with such plans. Why the agents of an important federal regulatory agency have singled out this technology for an intense review puzzles many observers in the medical-device field. Two meetings have been hosted by officials of the FDA to discuss the continuing concern the FDA officials have expressed over automated defibrillation technology. These meetings included representatives from the AHA, the American College of Cardiology, ACEP, defibrillator manufacturers, and other interested organizations. The FDA leadership has repeatedly focused on data acquired through the FDA Medical Device Reporting systems. Congress requires the FDA to investigate reports of problems with \"critical medical devices.\" Because the indication for the use of a defibrillator is cardiac arrest, there will inevitably be a high association between defibrillator use and patient deaths. FDA personnel may view such reports of device problems in association with patient deaths as evidence that an intrinsically flawed technology has reached the marketplace without rigorous testing and evaluation. From the clinician's perspective, however, these reports represent a small numerator over a huge denominator of daily, lifesaving clinical use. The non-FDA participants at the two meetings have stated that the FDA complaints appear to be random and reveal a lack of understanding of AED technology.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "Who will pay for investigational research? This seemingly endless debate assumes different guises as different aspects of the health care industry come under scrutiny. The latest wrinkle in the debate involves reimbursement for devices that are not FDA approved. My September column discussed the issue of funding investigational cancer therapies, specifically high-dose therapy and bone marrow transplant, as treatments for various malignancies. That controversy was centered on the use of FDA-approved drugs in settings beyond the labeled indications. However, the issue with medical devices is different. It involves implantable devices that the FDA says have not proven to be safe and effective.",

Both of these aliphatic polyesters belong to the a-hydroxy group and biodegrade in a physiological environment to monomeric acids, which are readily processed and excreted from the body. The physical and mechanical characteristics discussed include molecular weight, crystallinity, stress-strain behavior, permeability, and melting/glass transition temperatures. The most common methods of fabricating PLA-PGA materials into medical devices are described.",

        "To devise alternatives to randomized, controlled, clinical trials that clinicians and research experts might find acceptable for approval of devices used in critical care medicine.\nThe Coalition for Critical Care Excellence (Coalition) of the Society of Critical Care Medicine organized a consensus conference in which recognized critical care researchers gave testimony to a panel of experts regarding the process for testing and approval of monitoring devices.\nThe expert panel used testimony from the presenters as the basis of discussions on the testing and approval process. Guiding principles and specific recommendations were made based on the testimony given.\nThe panel determined the main constituents of the medical device approval process to be the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the research and clinical community, and the device manufacturers. Distinctions were made between monitoring and interventional device categories. This document addresses only monitoring devices. Potential alternatives to randomized, blinded, controlled study designs for device testing are: a) nonblinded, randomized, management protocol-driven study; b) crossover study (n-of-one design); c) cluster-randomization (randomized by care unit); d) case-matched controls; e) mixed design; f) on/off design (before-after); and g) historical controls.\nThe panel agreed on the following major recommendations: a) the FDA should accelerate publication of specific guidances for physiologic monitoring products with the assistance of the Coalition (priorities and content); b) more multidisciplinary research should be incorporated into new device studies; c) commonly accepted clinical tools may not need to be tested for clinical utility--these accepted tools should be identified by the Coalition; and d) an independent council of researchers and clinicians should make themselves available to serve as consultants to manufacturers regarding appropriate study design for the testing of devices.",
        "To assess the clinical efficacy and cost impact of a new medical device for the nonsurgical closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).\nThis was a before-after study comparing the most recent 20 surgical procedures with the first 20 nonsurgical procedures for PDA using a new medical device. Clinical outcome, hospital stay, device cost, and physician fees were compared.\nSurgical closure was effective in all 20 patients, with an average cost of $4667. In a similar patient group, nonsurgical closure was achieved in 18 of 20 patients (90%), with an estimated average cost per successful procedure of $4690. A clinically insignificant PDA leak persisted beyond 12 months in four nonsurgically managed patients.\nNonsurgical closure of PDA can be recommended as an effective new medical technique that is not associated with a measurable increase in direct costs and that provides significant indirect and intangible cost advantages.",

        "Excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is an experimental treatment to correct myopia (short-sightedness) that is diffusing into use without convincing evidence of safety and efficacy. It has been claimed that PRK may render conventional methods of correcting myopia, such as wearing glasses or contact lenses, obsolete. Since about 25% of the world's population is myopic, the consequences of this technology in terms of benefits, risks, and costs could be truly enormous. The fee for the procedure in various countries such as the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia varies from about US $1500 to US $2250 per eye. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration, acting as authorized in the Medical Devices Act of 1976, has limited the use of PRK to patients participating in clinical trials. In the Netherlands, in contrast, where medical equipment is not regulated, the method has diffused without controls, although it is not reimbursed by health insurance agencies. The procedure has become controversial in the Netherlands because it is provided privately and has been aggressively and inappropriately promoted. The case illustrates the limitations of health policy concerning technologies provided privately and raises a number of social and political questions.",

        "The use of various medical devices including indwelling vascular catheters, cardiac pacemakers, prosthetic heart valves, chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis catheters and prosthetic joints has greatly facilitated the management of serious medical and surgical illness. However, the successful development of synthetic materials and introduction of these artificial devices into various body systems has been accompanied by the ability of microorganism to adhere to these devices in the environment of biofilms that protect them from the activity of antimicrobial agents and from host defense mechanisms. A number of host, biomaterial and microbial factors are unique to the initiation, persistence and treatment failures of device-related infections. Intravascular catheters are the most common devices used in clinical practice and interactions associated with these devices are the leading cause of nosocomial bacteremias. The infections associated with these devices include insertion site infection, septic thrombophlebitis, septicemia, endocarditis and metastatic abscesses. Other important device-related infections include infections of vascular prostheses, intracardiac prostheses, total artificial hearts, indwelling urinary catheters, orthopedic prostheses, endotracheal tubes and extended wear lenses. The diagnosis and management of biofilm-associated infections remain difficult but critical issues. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy is often not effective in eradicating these infections and the removal of the device becomes necessary. Several improved diagnostic and therapeutic modalities have been reported in recent experimental studies. The clinical usefulness of these strategies remains to be determined.",
        "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that only heat sterilization be used for all reusable devices entering the oral cavity. However, chemical disinfection is still employed for reprocessing dental devices in many areas of the world. In an analysis of a Florida dental practice responsible for nosocomial human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmissions, the possible role of contaminated devices was deemed unlikely in part because they were subjected to high-level disinfection with 2% glutaraldehyde. Disease transmissions have, however, been documented for endoscopes used in diagnostic and surgical procedures even after this treatment. In some dental devices, lubricants mix with potentially infectious patient materials, and organic debris has been observed in endoscopes after cleaning. We have investigated whether lubricants can render high-level chemical disinfection procedures ineffective and have addressed the role that some common devices may play in disease transmission. We report here that HIV in whole-blood samples and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in blood and plasma survived high-level disinfection when entrapped in lubricants used in dental handpieces and endoscopes. We also found that lubricated dental devices used to clean and polish teeth (prophylaxis angles) have the potential to transfer sufficient amounts of blood to infect human lymphocyte cultures with HIV. These results emphasize the need to subject reusable dental devices to a heat-sterilization protocol that penetrates the lubricant.",

        "Air medical programs use medical equipment primarily designed for hospital and/or ground transport settings. Many of these medical devices are equipped with auditory alarms of malfunction or deteriorating clinical status. The high ambient noise requires visual scanning of medical devices to detect alarm conditions in the helicopter cabin.\nTo evaluate the adequacy of visual scanning for alarm conditions in the helicopter air medical environment.\nThe helicopter transport program used in this study is staffed with two medical crewmembers. Flight nurse response time (RT) to a visual alarm was assessed during 25 air medical patient flights. RT was measured using a battery powered dual timer device with a red LED visual alarm placed in a fixed position among the medical instruments. The device was activated at a random time point unknown to the medical crew during each patient flight. RT was defined as the elapsed time from activation of the alarm until it was physically switched off by the flight nurse.\nRT was surprisingly lengthy for the study population with a mean RT of 81.2 +/- 78.4 s (95% CI 48.8-113.5 s). The variability of RT was also surprising ranging from 3 s to > 5 min.\nRT to visual alarms in the air medical environment is lengthy and quite variable. Recognition of malfunction of medical equipment or early signs of clinical instability prior to clinical deterioration cannot be assured by visual scanning for alarm conditions. Alternative alarming systems should be considered and investigated for air medical transport.",
        "Tissue engineering may be defined as the application of the principles and techniques of biomedical engineering to products and processes involving living cells. As such it is located at the confluence of traditional medical device technology, molecular pharmacology, and cell biology. Effective function at this interface has proven both elusive and critical in tissue engineering research and is likely to remain a determinant of success or failure as products move from research through development and into clinical practice. As a further challenge, regulatory processes, traditions, and approval pathways are rather different for medical devices than for Pharmaceuticals and biologies, and commercialization of hybrid products will require knowledge and expertise in both areas. This review compares and contrasts the development cycle for medical devices and pharmaceutical products and highlights the major development issues facing emerging tissue engineering products.",
        "Novel emerging technologies such as tissue engineering, which utilize the approaches of molecular and cell biology, biotechnology, as well as materials science and engineering, are being used in the development of a wide range of biomedical products developed by industries regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA's mission is to promote and protect the public health by ensuring the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, including those manufactured by novel technology, as assessed by scientific principles and methods. Regulatory review is conducted on a product-by-product basis. To accomplish its mission over the wide range of products in its regulatory purview, the FDA has six centers, each staffed with the scientific and regulatory expertise to evaluate the products in the center's jurisdiction. Recent legislative and regulatory changes are designed to simplify and facilitate the administrative process for evaluating novel combination products emanating from such interdisciplinary technology as tissue engineering and to resolve questions of product regulatory jurisdiction. Under the new procedures, the FDA may designate a lead FDA center for product review based on the primary mode of action of the combination product, with additional center(s) designated to assist in the evaluation in a collaborative or consultative capacity. In addition, FDA centers have increased their cooperation and information sharing with regard to evolving interdisciplinary technology. The FDA InterCenter Tissue Engineering Initiative was established to develop information on intercenter efforts in the evaluation of tissue engineering applications and to identify areas for further consideration. The FDA InterCenter Tissue Engineering Working Group, comprised of staff from the Center for Biologies Evaluation and Research (CBER), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has developed a Draft Report considering recent developments in tissue engineering and scientific and regulatory issues in the product application areas. The Working Group has identified generic safety and effectiveness issues for consideration by the research and development community in its development of products. The FDA centers are using multiple approaches at their disposal in the evaluation of tissue engineered products including research, data and information monitoring, regulatory guidance, training and education, and cooperation with public and private groups.",
        "Four generations of surgical implant development will be discernible by the end of this century: 1. A first generation of industrial materials (materials originally fabricated for industrial applications other than medical devices) in ad hoc devices that had little impact on the practices of medicine and surgery. 2. Industrial materials in bioengineered devices to effect the replacement of damaged structures. While these devices returned function to millions of people, formed the basis for a new industry, and forever changed the practices of medicine and surgery, their components have proved less than ideal. 3. Bioengineered materials fabricated specifically for medical device use-that are meant to be bioactive rather than inert-and that promise to improve the performance of some devices. 4. Tissue engineering, which while yet to be utilized in widely marketed devices, promises to usher in revolutionary changes at least as dramatic as those caused by the second-generation bioengineered devices. Fourth-generation technologies will focus on repair and regeneration rather than reconstruction and replacement; they will emphasize therapeutic prevention of disease and early intervention. The minimally invasive nature of these new technologies will cause medical practitioners to partially displace surgeons, and fewer hospital beds and operating rooms will be needed. While such technology may involve high startup costs, in the long run the total costs of care should decline because of more efficient, less expensive procedures.",
        "The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) assigned the responsibility for developing valve standards to its technical committee on surgical implants. A sub-committee on cardiovascular implants and the working group for heart valves were formed more than 20 years ago. The working group has learned a great deal, not only from its experience with ISO, but most of all from the collaboration of its international experts representing science, engineering and manufacturing. The first valve standard was published in 1984, revised in 1989, and the next revision will probably be published in 1995. After the formation of this ISO working group in 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed regulations for the premarket approval of heart valves in the United States. The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) was subsequently formed and appointed a working group to develop heart valve standards for Europe. It rapidly became apparent that the lack of co-ordination and communication of three separate organizations writing documents with different requirements and tests would lead to inconsistent and conflicting requirements. The ultimate outcome could have been a threat to public welfare by limiting the availability of medical devices. The commitment to the harmonization of standards by CEN and ISO, and the recent FDA policy to participate actively in standards development, have greatly improved this situation. Past errors, omissions and inappropriate attitudes have often slowed the standards process or have resulted in incomplete standards. This learning experience, while painful, should point the way to more timely and complete standards development in the future.",
        "It is in the interest of parties to be able to test a defective explanted heart valve. This article identifies some of the relevant interests of patients (or their relatives), the manufacturers and society at large, and considers some of the legal issues involved in determining the ownership of valves in English law that arise from the varying nature of heart valves and the setting in which they are purchased and delivered. Ownership of explanted valves may vary according to whether the patient obtains the valve by private purchase, through the National Health Service, or through private health care insurance. It seems that, in the most common scenario (delivery via the National Health Service), the patient owns the valve (once implanted) by way of a gift, but that ownership revests to the health authority once the valve is explanted. The determination of ownership is, however, very complex. It is argued, however, that ownership does not automatically entail the right to test. So, even if it were determined that the patient (or the patient's estate) owned the valve, it would not follow that the patient had the right to control the testing of the valve or otherwise dispose of it. Close attention to the network of interests (both moral and socio-economic) in having explanted valves tested competently, suggests that it should be public policy to place custody of explanted valves (for the purposes of having them tested) in the hands of the Medical Devices Agency. This authority should be incorporated into regulation applying the European Community Medical Devices Directive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
        "Demands for health care cost containment have prompted the assessment of recycling medical devices, including catheters. The investigation of catheter reuse for effectiveness and safety began at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute in early 1994. This report provides the preliminary results from this ongoing assessment on the feasibility of catheter reuse. Burst tests were conducted to detect changes in catheter mechanical integrity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to assess surface changes and protein deposition after use and the subsequent cleaning process. Results of burst testing showed no significant difference in burst patterns or burst pressures between single use and unused catheters. Surface differences were observed between used and unused catheters. SEM studies detected physical changes such as scratches, gouges, cuts, and deposits on the used catheters. Unused balloon surfaces appeared to be clean and uniform compared to used ones. Residue and cracking were identified on other used devices. In conclusion, the methods used can assess various effects of recycling. A blind study of large samples of used catheters is planned to establish statistically the level and variance of structural damage to catheters during typical use.",
        "In situ surface modification techniques to improve the blood compatibility of blood contacting surfaces of medical devices have been developed by the authors. The techniques include heparin immobilization and sulfonated polymer grafting onto a polyurethane (PU) surface by using either ozone oxidation or photo reaction. These modified PUs were evaluated using an epifluorescent video microscope combined with a parallel plate flow cell. The epifluorescent video microscope system measured the amount of platelet coverage on the PU surfaces using whole human blood containing mepacrine labeled platelets perfused at a wall shear rate of 100 sec-1 for 20 min. Platelet activation and complement activation were also measured. Both immobilized heparin and sulfonated PUs showed significantly lower levels of platelet adhesion than the control PU. The platelet activation levels of these modified PUs also correspond to the results of the platelet adhesion. As for complement activation, heparin the immobilized surface showed the least complement activation, while sulfonated PU and the control PU showed higher levels of complement activation. In situ surface modification techniques, which use either ozone oxidation or photo reaction, are useful in a variety of medical devices even of a complex design, such as membrane oxygenators or artificial hearts.",
        "During the last four decades there has been a rapid increase in the development and usage of medical devices. Currently, there are more than 500,000 devices on the market and 25,000 new devices enter the market each year. Many medical devices are now designed to be implantable (pacemakers, defibrillators, circulatory assist devices, artificial hearts, cochlear implants, neuromuscular stimulators, biosensors, etc.). Almost all of the active devices (those that perform work) and many of the passive devices (those that do not perform work) require a source of power. In addition, these devices need to be monitored and controlled, which can be accomplished by utilizing remote communication methods. A transcutaneous energy transfer system combined with a remote communications system has been developed and evaluated in vitro and in vivo (bovine, porcine, and human cadaver experiments). The energy transfer system can deliver up to 60 W with power transfer efficiencies between 60 and 83%. An automatically tuned, resonant frequency tracking method is used to obtain optimum power transfer over a range of operating conditions. The remote communications system can transfer digital data bidirectionally through intact skin at rates up to 9600 baud. The system transmits information by frequency modulating an 890 nm infrared carrier signal. The system has demonstrated satisfactory performance during multicenter evaluation with ventricular assist and total artificial heart devices. Design improvements have been identified, which will be implemented to produce an optimized system for energy transfer to and remote communications with various implantable medical devices.",

        "To study the relationship of task strain and physical fitness to fatigue among nurses employed at social welfare facilities, we investigated the degree of habitual end-of-work fatigue among 99 nurses (ages 20-49 years) in its relationship to both the degree of strain in various tasks and various indices of physical fitness. Results were as follows: (1) Fatigue complaint rates were nearly the same (35-38%) regardless of age. (2) Mean arm power and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) were significantly lower in a high degree of fatigue group than a low degree of fatigue group. (3) Four of 21 tasks elicited strain complaint rates greater than 50%: \"nursing of seriously ill patients\", \"nursing of medical device-assisted patients\", \"bathing care\", and \"excretory/diaper changing care\". (4) Significant positive correlations were noted between the degree of fatigue and the degree of strain complaint with regard to \"nursing of medical device-assisted patients\", \"bathing care\", and \"excretory/diaper changing care\". (5) Strain complaint rates were significantly higher in a low arm power group than a high arm power group with regard to \"nursing of seriously ill patients\", \"nursing of medical device-assisted patients\", and \"excretory/diaper changing care\". (6) Strain complaint rates were significantly higher in a low VO2max group than a high VO2max group with regard to \"nursing of medical device-assisted patients\", \"bathing care\", and \"excretory/diaper changing care\". These results suggest the need for measures to alleviate task strain and to increase arm strength and overall stamina so that nursing work does not result in excessive fatigue.",
        "To correlate patient condition and reasons for obtaining chest radiographs (CXRs) with the utility of CXRs in critical illness and to determine the potential impact of stricter criteria for obtaining a CXR in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU).\nInception cohort study of 1003 CXRs examined prospectively.\nA total of 157 consecutive patients admitted to the general surgical ICU of a 780-bed, urban, university-affiliated, tertiary care hospital.\nNothing was done to influence the ordering of CXRs.\nInfluence of CXR findings on clinical management.\nThe likelihood of a clinically important finding was 17% for CXRs obtained for no clear clinical indication (routine), 26% for those obtained to verify the position of a medical device, and 30% for those obtained for suspected clinical conditions. By univariate analysis, suspected pathophysiologic condition, admission APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score, presence of a central venous or Swan-Ganz catheter, and length of ICU stay were all predictors of a significant finding. By multivariate analysis, the only independent predictor of a finding was a suspected clinical condition, and the only indwelling medical device that was an independent predictor of a finding was a Swan-Ganz catheter. If the criterion that routine CXRs should only be obtained in patients with Swan-Ganz catheters had been used, 200 CXRs would have been avoided during the 3-month study period. The only findings missed by not obtaining those CXRs would have been two malpositioned nasogastric tubes and one malpositioned central venous catheter.\nChest radiographs should only be obtained on surgical ICU patients for specific indications. Routine CXRs for ICU patients are justified only for patients with indwelling Swan-Ganz catheters.",

The Food and Drug Administration's \"Final Report of the Committee for Clinical Review\" found that clinical trials were carried out with little planning or attention to the purpose of the study. It is urged that the medical profession assist in the establishment of complication rates associated with each type of implant and surgical procedure and that surgeons and professional societies need to be more critically involved in the setting up of performance standards for implants prior to their approval by the Food and Drug Administration.

        "Although there have been many previous reports of serious medical device malfunctions caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI), it is not widely recognized that many such malfunctions were \"silent,\" having occurred without triggering a device alarm. The authors describe one such malfunction, and its implications. An 8-year-old radiant heater, which appeared to be operating normally in a neonatal intensive care unit, was observed, by mere chance, to intermittently register an increased, or decreased, neonatal skin temperature of about 1 degree C, depending on personnel movements and on its location in the room. The possibility that EMI had been the cause of this malfunction was investigated. The malfunction stopped in an adjacent windowless room, but again occurred when a 146-MHz walkie-talkie (100 mW) was used within a 1-2-m radius. More complete (0.1-1,000 MHz, 4.5-10 V/m maximum) test-chamber assessment of EMI susceptibility showed that the heater malfunctioned at electric field strengths above 0.3-1 V/m over four roughly 50-MHz bands between about 10 and 600 MHz. A previous electromagnetic environment survey had documented fairly high fields (0.01-0.3 V/m, 30-1,000 MHz) in the original malfunction area. Combined results suggested that the malfunction had been due to EMI from nearby fixed-source FM transmission antennas, which could be seen from the room's windows. The device had probably been malfunctioning for months, even though it had been regularly checked during preventive maintenance. Other identical, but newer, units functioned normally, or malfunctioned negligibly. Although operation of the older device deviated only \"slightly\" from normal, the consequences of this malfunction could have been serious.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "The formation of a toxic and carcinogenic compound, methylenedianiline (MDA), in sterilized medical use polyurethane (PU) is discussed. Due to good biocompatibility and biostability, PU is widely used for blood-containing devices. There are two types of PU currently available for medical use. One is chain-extended thermoplastic PU, the other is thermosetting PU used for potting material connecting fibers and modules in artificial dialyzers and plasma separators. Both gamma-ray irradiation and autoclave sterilization are predominantly used for the sterilization of these devices. MDA formation in sterilized PUs by gamma-ray irradiation and by autoclave treatment is compared. The Delany clause in the USA prohibits the manufacture of medical devices producing any toxic compound during fabrication and sterilization, therefore, the formation and elution of MDA and other toxic compounds should be seriously considered. Although MDA formation at a concentration of a few to a few hundred ppb in autoclaved chain-extended thermoplastic PU has been reported, there have been no papers describing MDA formation in autoclaved thermosetting PU potting material, or describing MDA formation in gamma-ray irradiated chain-extended thermoplastic PU and thermosetting PU. We elected to determine whether MDA was in fact produced in Pus sterilized by gamma-ray irradiation or by autoclave sterilization. Our objective was to estimate the risk factor to the human patients or recipient. Our conclusion is to confirm which sterilization of gamma-ray or autoclave is more appropriate. No formation of MDA was observed in autoclaved thermosetting PU potting material at 121 degrees C for 60 min. A few ppm of MDA was formed in irradiated potting material. MDA formation increased with increasing irradiation doses. MDA formed in irradiated potting material at 2.5 Mrad (less than one ppm) is not a significant risk to the recipient. The estimated cancer causing risk factor when absorbing one mg MDA/kg body weight/day is 0.29. Twenty-nine persons per 100 persons exhibit a cancer potential. More importantly, our experimental evidence indicated that serum extracts from irradiated potting material contained unknown compounds other than MDA. The presence of these compounds is considerably more significant and toxic. When tested, these compounds proved to be mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activity, thus promoting a need to identify and study further. Compounds indicating mutagenicity increased with increasing irradiation. Small amounts of mutagenic compounds were determined in extract from autoclaved potting material, smaller than that by gamma-ray irradiation. Therefore, autoclave sterilization is more appropriate, providing materials can withstand the process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The Clinton/Gore proposal favors excluding drug and biologic manufacturers from requirements for more environmental assessments and only indirectly addresses drug development. Oregon Democratic Congressman Ron Wyden introduced an FDA reform bill which calls for the FDA to use expert panels, independent testing organizations, and institutional review boards (IRB) to help speed new drugs and devices through the approval process. The bill calls for the use of the IRB for the approval (or denial) of applications for Phase I review of new drugs. Not surprisingly, the AIDS community has differing views on the reform at the FDA. The Treatment Action Group (TAG), whose members hold key positions in well-known AIDS groups, supports the status quo at FDA and is lobbying AIDS organizations across the country to sign on to its FDA Reform Principles. Other AIDS treatment activists, such as members of ACT UP, favor local IRB jurisdiction over Phase I research.",
        "Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was developed in the late 1970s as a nonsurgical alternative for revascularization of atherosclerotic coronary arteries. It gained widespread acceptance without a controlled trial. Introduced in 1986, directional coronary atherectomy was the first of other recently developed coronary devices that sought to improve on the results of angioplasty. It was approved in 1990 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the basis of observational data. Its use expanded rapidly, reaching over 35,000 procedures in 1992, accounting for more than 10% of all interventions. After premarket approval, two major randomized trials tested the hypothesis that atherectomy would be superior to angioplasty. Their results raised a cautionary flag and stood in contrast to projections made from prior observational data. It is concluded that randomized controlled trials validate claims of relative efficacy and safety of competing medical technologies, a lesson reflected in recent changes in policy at the FDA.",

        "The recent American Association of Blood Banks publications Quality Program and Quality Systems in the Blood Bank and Laboratory Environment, the FDA's draft guidelines, and recent changes in the GMP regulations all discuss the benefits of implementing quality systems in blood center and/or manufacturing operations. While the medical device GMPs in the United States have been rewritten to accommodate a quality system approach similar to ISO 9000, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research of the FDA is also beginning to make moves toward adopting \"quality systems audits\" as an inspection process rather than using the historical approach of record reviews. The approach is one of prevention of errors rather than detection after the fact (Tourault MA, oral communication, November 1994). The ISO 9000 series of standards is a quality system that has worldwide scope and can be applied in any industry or service. The use of such international standards in blood banking should raise the level of quality within an organization, among organizations on a regional level, within a country, and among nations on a worldwide basis. Whether an organization wishes to become registered to a voluntary standard or not, the use of such standards to become ISO 9000-compliant would be a move in the right direction and would be a positive sign to the regulatory authorities and the public that blood banking is making a visible effort to implement world-class quality systems in its operations. Implementation of quality system standards such as the ISO 9000 series will provide an organized approach for blood banks and blood bank testing operations. With the continued trend toward consolidation and mergers, resulting in larger operational units with more complexity, quality systems will become even more important as the industry moves into the future.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Infection is a common complication associated with the use of transcutaneous and implanted medical devices. These infections are generally difficult to treat and frequently require removal of the biomaterial before the infection can be completely eradicated. The presence of a bacterial biofilm recalcitrant to treatment often mediates these infections. We studied the influence of a polycationic protein, protamine sulfate, on the efficacy of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin against a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A P. aeruginosa biofilm was developed on 1-cm sections of red rubber catheter material and then treated with various combinations of protamine sulfate and ciprofloxacin. The present work demonstrated that ciprofloxacin in combination with protamine was more effective against biofilms than was ciprofloxacin alone. Protamine sulfate at 50 micrograms/ml combined with antibiotic at 0.5 microgram/ml reduced the number of viable cells by an average of 98.97%, while protamine sulfate at 50 micrograms/ml alone resulted in an average 107.8% increase and antibiotic alone resulted in an average 58.6% reduction after 24 h. Furthermore, protamine sulfate, in combination with ciprofloxacin, inhibited P. aeruginosa in a dose-dependent fashion. It was further observed that treatment with the combination of protamine sulfate and ciprofloxacin had a more drastic effect on planktonic organisms as compared with the P. aeruginosa biofilms; the MBC was reduced to < 0.05 microgram/ml in the presence of 25 micrograms of protamine sulfate per ml. These findings were substantiated by ultrastructure studies of treated cells using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The synergism between ciprofloxacin and protamine sulfate significantly enhanced the efficacy of ciprofloxacin against planktonic and biofilm P. aeruginosa.",
        "During the development of infection, pathogens are translocated from one body site to another and so must readily adapt to changing environmental conditions. The influence of host environment on bacterial behaviour and virulence gene expression is, however, often overlooked. Environmental signals such as temperature, pH and nutrient (especially iron) availability which inform pathogens of their living conditions thus contribute to both bacterial survival and virulence. In the context of medical device-associated infections such as peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, the pathogenesis of infection is related to the ability of the infecting organism to multiply, to adhere to catheter polymers and host tissues and to evade host defences. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) such as Staphylococcus epidermidis are commonly responsible for CAPD-associated peritonitis. Although staphylococci cannot grow in commercial peritoneal dialysate solutions, these fluids are modified during dialysis and become enriched by a plasma ultrafiltrate which can support bacteria growth. Given that growth environment exerts considerable influence on bacterial behaviour, the physiology of CNS cultured in vitro in a model system employing pooled human peritoneal dialysate and in vivo in implanted peritoneal chambers in the rat has been investigated. Using such models marked variation in surface physicochemistry, antibiotic susceptibility and adherence to catheter polymers has been observed. This plasticity is clearly reflected in the cell envelope phenotype of CNS, the study of which has recently lead to the discovery of a staphylococcal receptor for the iron-binding serum glycoprotein, transferrin.",

Avanti, the first male polyurethane condom, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991, before the agency began requiring manufacturers of medical devices to perform extensive clinical testing prior to marketing. FDA officials now acknowledge that allowing the innovative condom on the market without clinical efficacy data was a mistake. However, rather than recalling the condom, the FDA is requesting that both the NICHD and the company that manufactured Avanti retest the condom. Avanti is the first latex-free, HIV-impermeable condom available to the estimated five percent of the population that is allergic to latex. According to the FDA, denying those users the condom until efficacy studies are completed is not an option with the AIDS epidemic. However, the FDA does not encourage it for the general public.

The three procedures included extraction with water, extraction with acetone, and headspace gas analysis, respectively. Materials were processed through an industrial EO cycle and aerated for various periods to achieve target levels of a low (5 micrograms/g), medium (10 micrograms/g), and high (25 micrograms/g) residual determination following extraction or thermal desorption. The results of this study, using only the data from the laboratories that did not deviate from the procedure, showed that the average estimated total coefficient of variation ranged from 3.63 to 12.42% for the three different methods. Each of the methods is suitable for use as a reference test method for determining residual EO in polymeric materials in the concentration range 2.8-42.3 micrograms/g.",
        "We proposed that a similar mechanism for calcification exists for poly(ether)urethanes and glutaraldehyde stabilized tissue. The mechanism is based on the propensity of the polyether component of the materials to complex calcium and provide initiating sites for ultimate formation of calcific deposits. Data evaluating the role ether containing materials have on calcification demonstrate that the rate of mineralization of either tissue valves or polymer valves can be controlled by paying attention to the basic chemical mechanism of complexation occurring at the surface and within the bulk of the implant devices. The molecular models described above, point out that the driving force for complexation with either the polyethers of the polyurethane or the polyether of glutaraldehyde is very strong, therefore, controlling the driving force may lead to medical devices with longer term durability.",
        "The sudden and unilateral decision by E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., Inc., to withdraw its polymers for use in implantable devices has presented the medical device industry with an immediate and serious challenge to find alternative sources of biomaterials. In France, the company Cardial S.A. has already taken steps to find an alternative polyester yarn to replace Dacron by developing a new arterial prosthesis knitted from polyester yarns supplied by Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Fibres. This article describes an in vitro and in vivo study of this French device, called the Dialine prosthesis, with a view to determining its relative performance compared to current American and British prostheses, which rely on DuPont's Dacron yarn. In addition to analyses of the morphology and textile structure, and measurements of its physical and chemical properties, the Dialine graft was implanted as a thoracoabdominal bypass in dogs for periods ranging from 4 h to 6 months. In addition to our pathologic and histologic observations, we cleaned and evaluated the explanted prostheses for in vivo changes in dimensions, strength, and crystalline microstructure. The Dialine graft was found to differ structurally from other polyester prostheses because it is warp-knitted from a mixture of flat and texturized yarns with finer filaments. Its denser structure has a lower water permeability, greater flexibility and ease of handling, satisfactory strength, and dimensional stability, and it presents different textures on its luminal and external surfaces. The in vivo trial demonstrated that it has excellent biocompatibility and biostability over 6 months. With no thrombi observed on the luminal surface after 3 months, it has a faster rate of healing, generates compact external and internal capsules with a thinner neointima, and has an overall milder inflammatory response than is normally observed with Dacron-based prostheses.",

        "Ethylene oxide (ETO) is an important industrial intermediate used extensively in the production of ethylene glycol, as a fumigant, and as a sterilant of choice for various medical devices. The mutagenicity of ETO was studied for the induction of specific-locus mutations in the adenine-3 (ad-3) region of a two-component heterokaryon (H-12) of Neurospora crassa. The objectives of these studies with ETO were to rank its mutagenic potency and to compare its mutational spectrum for induced specific-locus mutations with other chemical mutagens in this lower eukaryotic organism. Specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region of heterokaryon H12 result from gene/point mutations at the closely linked ad-3A and ad-3B loci, multilocus deletion mutations and multiple-locus mutations. These major genotypic classes are similar to the types of specific-locus mutations that can be detected in higher organisms. Conidial suspensions of H-12 were treated with five different concentrations of ETO (0.1-0.35%) for 3 h at 25 degrees C. Control and ETO-treated conidial suspensions were used to obtain dose-response curves for inactivation as well as the overall induction of ad-3 forward mutations using a non-selective method based on pigment accumulation rather than a requirement for adenine. The results from these experiments are: (1) the slope of the dose-response curve for ETO-induced specific-locus mutations in the ad-3 region is 1.49 +/- 0.07, and (2) the maximum forward-mutation frequency fell between 10 and 100 ad-3 mutations per 10(6) survivors; therefore, ETO is a moderate mutagen. Classical genetic tests were used to characterize the ETO-induced ad-3 mutations from each of two treatments (0.25 and 0.35%). The overall data base demonstrates that ETO-induced ad-3 mutations result from a high percentage (96.9%) of gene/point mutations at the ad-3A and ad-3B loci, as well as from a low percentage (3.1%) of multilocus deletion mutations. The mutagenic activity of ETO is compared with the mutagenic specificity of other chemical mutagens and carcinogens in the ad-3 forward-mutation assay in Neurospora. The utilization of the Neurospora specific-locus data on ETO and those from experiments in the mouse and Drosophila, by others, is discussed for genetic risk assessment of germ-cell effects resulting from human exposure to ETO in the workplace.",

        "The antibacterial activity of silver-containing compounds has recently been employed in constructing medical devices, such as vascular and urinary catheters, that may be effective in blocking infection. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a silver oxide-coated urinary catheter.\nA total of 1,309 hospitalized patients who required placement of an indwelling urinary catheter for 24 hours or longer were randomly assigned to receive either a silicone catheter coated externally with 5% silver oxide or a standard silicone elastomer-coated latex catheter. Daily catheter-urine specimens were collected aseptically and catheter-care violations were monitored daily for the duration of the catheterization.\nBacteriuria developed in 85 of 745 patients (11.4%) in the silver-coated catheter group and in 73 of 564 patients (12.9%) in the control group (P = 0.45). In women who did not receive antibiotics, the rates were 29.3% and 30.4%, respectively (P = 0.98). In men who did not receive antibiotics, the rate of bacteriuria was significantly higher with the silver-coated catheter (29.4% compared to 8.3%, respectively, P = 0.02). Staphylococcal species were isolated more often from the silver-coated catheter group than from the control group (25% versus 8% of all isolates, respectively, P = 0.002).\nThis study, the largest ever reported evaluating any silver-impregnated device, has not only failed to demonstrate the efficacy of silver in prevention of catheter-associated bacteriuria, as suggested in prior studies, but it has also shown a significantly increased incidence of bacteriuria in male patients and a significantly increased occurrence of staphylococcal bacteriuria. These results suggest the need for caution and for similar large-scale trials before silver-containing compounds are widely used for preventing device-associated infections, both in vascular and urinary catheters.",
        "Advances in medical science and, in particular, minimally invasive surgical and diagnostic procedures have stimulated the development of new and improved medical devices. This has been made possible because of developments in engineering and material sciences. The design of devices for reusability is particularly important in an effort to provide cost effective healthcare. Concerns and issues include the ability to safely and effectively reprocess the devices, infection prevention and control, safety of the patient and healthcare worker, environmental concerns, and effective use of resources. From an infection prevention point of view, present requirements are based upon the intended use of the devices. Critical devices require sterilization. Semi-critical devices require, as a minimum, high level disinfection. Sterilization is, however, preferred whenever possible. Before sterilization or disinfection, devices should be cleaned adequately. Device designs should be readily amenable to cleaning and sterilization. In the past, design requirements focused primarily on the clinical user and device functionality, with reuse considerations left to the user. In the current market, the customer is redefined and, for reusable medical devices, includes all those associated with the device through the reprocessing procedure. In addition, regulations require that manufacturers give detailed instructions for reprocessing medical devices. The device users have the obligation to follow reprocessing instructions. Many choices exist today in device designs, including disposable or reusable devices. The user needs to balance cost versus convenience and reprocessing requirements for reusables. Current trends are to reuse more devices, including many of which were meant to be disposable. Cost effective designs can best be achieved when the user and manufacturer work together on the design.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "China has approximately 6 million totally deaf people according to an official survey conducted in 1990, although the actual number is probably higher. A primary cause of deafness is the use of ototoxic drugs. There does not appear to be any emergent deaf culture in China at present. As the only available medical device that can restore partial hearing to a totally deaf person, the cochlear implant has been in development in China since 1979. This paper provides an overview of cochlear implants in China and is based on a review of published materials, visits to research institutes and hospitals, and personal communication with Chinese colleagues. As of 1993, about 1,000 deaf people, including 50 children below age 12 years, have received four types of single-electrode cochlear implants that were developed and fabricated by institutions in China. These single-electrode devices have provided an aid to lip reading, but are no longer in use due to their inability to produce open-set speech recognition. Present implant research in China focuses on development of multi-electrode devices. Basic research in electrical stimulation is relatively lacking and standardized audiological evaluation for cochlear implant effectiveness needs to be developed. The present economic growth and legal system reform in China, combined with advances in implant technology, may make it possible to produce an affordable yet effective cochlear implant system. This paper discusses cochlear implants only in China, but the social and economic factors are similar in many developing countries in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, and Africa, where a low-cost, high-performance cochlear implant system is also needed.",

        "Medical devices (tubes, catheters, lines, prostheses, etc.) are a common finding on radiologic studies. Sometimes they may be misdiagnosed as a pathologic process, or an important observation concerning a medical device may be overlooked because of lack of familiarity with a particular device. This review discusses a variety of tubes, lines, catheters, and other interesting and important medical devices found on everyday radiologic studies. Whenever an unusual radiologic finding is encountered, the first question to be asked is, \"Is the finding a film artifact or an artifact of the imaging modality itself (computed radiography, computed tomography [CT], ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], nuclear medicine)? If not, does it represent a medical device or foreign material in or on the patient?\" All those who interpret radiologic studies should develop the good habits of obtaining and reviewing the patient's prior studies and should, in addition, read the prior radiology reports. Good reading habits, combined with a knowledge of imaging artifacts, medical devices, foreign bodies, and normal anatomic variants, provide a solid starting point for the interpretation of radiologic studies. One very important factor often not appreciated by radiologists and referring physicians is that, in many instances, the radiologic visibility of a medical device has been given no thought, and the device has been designed with no input from the radiologic community. To compound this problem further, devices are often purchased by a hospital or medical center for the lowest price. Those purchasing devices frequently fail to seek advice from radiologists and other physicians concerning the radiologic detectability of the devices they purchase. Medical devices are manufactured from a variety of substances known as biomaterials. These include various types of metals, polymers, rubbers, ceramics, and composites. Biomaterials are substances brought into contact with living tissue for the purpose of treating a medical or dental problem. They must be compatible with human tissues chemically, mechanically, and pharmacologically. There are many ways to classify biomaterials, such as synthetic versus \"natural,\" permanent versus transient, liquid versus solid, hard versus soft, and so forth. Although most life-support devices are within the patient's heart, blood vessels, lungs, or pleura, miscellaneous tubing, clamps, syringes, electrocardiograph (ECG) leads, and other apparatus often lie on or under the patient and appear on radiographs, especially chest studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "A new sterilization system using vapour-phase hydrogen peroxide (VPHP) was recently developed. The cytotoxicity of various medical materials sterilized by the VPHP sterilization system was investigated. After VPHP sterilization, polystyrene, polyurethane (PU8), blend material of silicone and polyurethane (Sil/PU6), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), fluorosilicone acrylate and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (HEMA) showed strong cytotoxicity, whereas polyethylene and polypropylene did not. Although the cytotoxic potential of most materials is reduced by extension of the aeration time, HEMA and PMMA still retained strong cytotoxicity after 12 h aeration. Addition of catalase to the cell culture eliminated the cytotoxicity of sterilized polystyrene and PU8. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) residues remaining in the sterilized materials were determined. Large amounts of H2O2 (5.1-186 micrograms) were detected in HEMA, PU8, Sil/PU6 and PMMA. In contrast, silicone and polyethylene contained low levels of H2O2. The amounts of residual H2O2 in the materials decreased with increasing aeration time, but the elimination rate of H2O2 differed among the test materials. The cytotoxic potential of the VPHP-sterilized materials correlated with the amounts of residual H2O2 present. These results indicated that the cytotoxicity of VPHP-sterilized materials was caused by the residual H2O2. To generalize the developed VPHP sterilization system for various medical devices, it is important to validate the aeration of materials for removal of cytotoxic residuals.",
        "The observation that endotoxin caused gelation in extracts of Limulus amebocytes has been expanded to the development of an in vitro kinetic, quantitative chromogenic LAL assay (Kinetic-QCL) for the detection of endotoxin in aqueous fluids. Within the last 15 years, the use of Limulus amebocyte lysate to detect and control the presence of pyrogenic substances in pharmaceuticals and medical devices has gained wide international acceptance. Both the United States and European Pharmacopoeias contain descriptions of and requirements for the LAL Bacterial Endotoxin Test. Both pharmacopoeias have begun to remove the rabbit pyrogen test requirement in a majority of drug monographs and have substituted endotoxin limits to be determined by LAL. The use of LAL has proved invaluable in controlling the level of endotoxin in finished product. The endotoxin contribution of raw materials and packaging material can be monitored as well. In-process testing at critical production steps can identify additional sources of endotoxin contamination, and depyrogenation processes can be validated by quantitating the degradation of endotoxin challenges. The speed, reproducibility, sensitivity, and economics of the Kinetic-QCL assay, in conjunction with the ppropriate equipment and software, over both the in vivo rabbit pyrogen test and the more traditional LAL gel-clot assay allow a more in-depth approach to the control of endotoxin in pharmaceuticals and medical devices.",
        "This article describes the use of the LAL-test as a product release test for parenterals, medical devices and dialysis solutions. Since the LAL-test has been established in the pharmaceutical industries, the possibility to use this test as product release test in lieu of the classical test for pyrogens in rabbits has been discussed: The supporters of the LAL-test argued with its high sensitivity, easy to use, low costs and last but not least with the possibility to avoid experiments with animals. Those who disapproved on the test to be used as a product release test mainly for parenterals feared that - due to the high specifity of the LAL-test - non-endotoxin pyrogens could no longer be detected. Since some years the LAL-test has been introduced into the monograph \"Parenterals\" of the European (German) Pharmacopeia and is mentioned under the tests the parenterals have to comply with.",

We studied the present and future impact caused by the market removal of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) yarn (\"Dacron\"), polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) fiber and resin (\"Teflon\"), and polyacetal resin (\"Delrin\"). Findings were: 1) Dollar values of the permanent medical implant markets for PET yarn, PTFE fiber and resin, and polyacetal resin are a minute fraction, of their values for their other commercial markets; 2) The implant market value is clearly not commensurate with the liability risk; and 3) The majority of these materials consumed by this market are used in the production of lifesaving, permanent medical implants [e.g., vital blood vessel replacements made from knitted polyester (PET)]. The remainder is used in life-enhancing, permanent implants [e.g., hernia patches made of polyester (PET) fabric].",

        "Many types of proprietary processing aids are used by the manufacturers of polymer medical devices, which are difficult to completely eliminate from the end product. In such cases, it is important to investigate how such processing aids affect the properties of the materials. One such material is Pellethane and a most commonly found processing aid is wax. We investigated the effect of the presence of such wax on hecompatibility properties, particularly on the adhesion and activation of human platelets, on a group of Pellethane samples with varying amounts of wax. The effectiveness of cleaning agents, like Freon, was examined for wax removal. The type and quantity of wax present within the near-surface regions of the Pellethane tubings was estimated by using the FT-IR-ATR technique. The presence of bis amide processing wax was found to affect the hemocompatibility properties of the Pellethane samples. Correlation between hemocompatibility and the amount of wax was made; platelet activation, as well as amount and density of fibrin formation, showed a linear correlation.",
        "1. CURRICULUM DESCRIPTION. Twenty years ago, our faculty organized several lessons in a physiology course to inform students about computers. Recently, new courses in informatics were established. In their first year, students take a compulsory course (15 hours=h) of basic computer science (computers databases, networking, and basic non-medical computer software). A special elective course in medical informatics (30h) can be taken in the 4th year (about 20% of students pass tis course). This course includes the following lessons: computers in medicine (2h), scientific information (4h), classification in medicine (2h- including ICD, SNOMED etc.), computer support of clinical decision (2h-calculation principles with demonstration), artificial intelligence (2h), statistical software (2h), hospital information systems (2h), software for practitioners (2h), biosignal and image analysis (4th), computers in pharmacology (2h), computer simulation (2h), support of metabolic care (2h-consultations, risk calculations), and laboratory information systems (2h). The same course, though slightly differences, is used for paramedical students (occupational therapy, health education, and nursing). Medical technology was established in a three year curriculum courses in the 1st year include common courses in electronic devices (60 h), computers and programming (120 h), biophysics (90 h), biomechanics (30 h), and different medical courses (500 h). For the 2nd and 3rd year, 75% of the courses (700 h per year) are technical e.g., medical devices, information systems, signal and picture analysis, laboratory technique, and data protection. 2. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES. Students of medicine, and some paramedical studies, are able to use computer in their profession after having taken these courses. Bachelors of medical technology find application in biomedical research, hospitals, and medical technology firms.",
        "The central issue facing federal regulation of breast implants is that while such devices are not functionally necessary or needed for survival, the side effects may be harmful and have not been proven unharmful. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 appear to require such evidence prior to the FDA permitting the unrestricted marketing of these devices. However, only recently have such requirements been imposed by the FDA. The author examines the FDA's decision-making process, particularly as applied to silicone breast implants, and the factors that appears to have affected such decisions. In pursuing this study, the activities of a number of interest-group actors, as well as congressional responses and the role of federal bureaucratic actors, were examined. In 1992, the FDA established a regulatory protocol that effectively withdrew most silicone breast implants from the market for the purpose of breast augmentation and allows for the monitoring of the impact of new implants on women's health. This increase concern for determining the safety of breast implants is due to a number of factors, which are examined in this article.",

        "Two well-known polysaccharides, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan and mannan, are major structural components of the fungus cell wall. The G test is a direct method to measure (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan using a (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan-sensitive component, factor G, fractionated from the limulus lysate. The concentration of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in culture supernatants of Candida albicans increased to 1,390.0 pg/ml at 24 hours. The concentration of mannan also increased parallel with fungal growth. However, after digestion of supernatants with endo-(1-->3)-beta-D-glucanase, the reactivity to factor G disappeared, although titers of antimannan monoclonal antibody-based latex agglutination were unchanged. Our study demonstrated that cell suspensions of both C. albicans and Cryptoccocus neoformans activated the limulus factor G, and that not only the conidia form but also the filamentous form of Aspergillus fumigatus reacted with factor G. Various Candida spp. (C. paraspilosis, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. krusei), Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula rubra, Trichosporon beigelii, and A. fumigatus released soluble (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan into their culture supernatants, but C. neoformans and Cunninghamella bertholletiae showed only a small reaction to the G test during their culture. Our results indicate that the G test is a good method for serodiagnosis of deep mycosis and also as a screening tool for contamination of medical devices, drugs, and experimental materials with (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan.",

        "Data on pacemaker implantation were obtained from the Medical Device Implant Supplement to the 1988 National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative, population-based survey of 47,485 households (122,310 persons). The survey yielded an estimate of 456,482 noninstitutionalized adults with pacemakers (prevalence, 2.6 per 1,000). Prevalence rose significantly with age, from 0.4 per 1,000 among persons ages 18-64 to 26 per 1,000 among those ages 75 or older. Age-adjusted prevalence in males was 1.5 times that in females, and in whites 1.6 times that in nonwhites, although these differences were of borderline statistical significance. Prevalence did not vary significantly by region of residence, educational level, or income, but was significantly increased (more than threefold) in those reporting any activity limitation compared with those with no limitation. Fifteen percent of pacemakers in use were replacements; about one-fifth of these had been replaced more than twice. Sixty percent of previous pacemakers had been in place for at least 5 years. These data provide the first nationwide, population-based estimates of the epidemiology of pacemaker implantation, focusing particularly on the demographics of U.S. pacemaker recipients.",
        "The Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the Food and Drug Administration, in collaboration with the National Center for Health Statistics, conducted the Medical Device Implant Supplement to the 1988 National Health Interview Survey, generating the 1st available population-based estimates of the use of prosthetic heart valves in the United States. The 1988 National Health Interview Survey was a massive, nationally representative cross-sectional survey that encompassed 47,485 households and 122,310 individuals. Data from the Medical Device Implant Supplement indicate that an estimated 253,283 persons with 279,175 heart valves were present in the civilian, non-institutionalized US population (population prevalence of 1.1/1,000, 95% CI 0.8-1.3). Prevalence of valve prostheses ranged from 0.2 per 1,000 in those age 44 and under to 5.3 per 1,000 in those 75 years of age and older. Age-adjusted prevalence of valve prostheses did not differ significantly according to sex, race, region of residence, education, or income of recipients. Two thirds of aortic valve recipients identified by the survey were male, compared with only one third of mitral valve recipients. Approximately two thirds of both aortic and mitral valve implants were reported as mechanical. Reported use of anticoagulative agents was significantly more common in recipients of mechanical than of bioprosthetic valves. The single most common reported reason for prosthetic valve implantation was rheumatic heart disease. These data provide useful epidemiologic and public health planning information on prosthetic heart valve use.",
        "Genotoxic effects are hardly assessable in an exposed population but are generally considered to be serious due to their unpredictable effects on subsequent generations and to the link between genotoxicity and cancer. Lack of knowledge about a genotoxic/carcinogenic potential has to be stated for numerous compounds which are often in pharmaceutical use known for a long time. A thorough testing programme like it is done for new compounds is essential for such compounds that are not completely unsuspicious with respect to being reactive with macromolecules or that have the potential to generate reactive metabolites in the body. Paracetamol, anthraquinone-containing preparations, and griseofulvin are examples for pharmaceuticals that have been in use for a long time but for which genotoxicity testing revealed a possible deleterious potential only recently. The Federal Health Office/Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices therefore imposed new studies upon companies marketing these compounds in the last years. These studies in part led to a more thorough description of possible adverse effects or even restrictions for use. Paracetamol exhibits a genotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo probably via indirect, cytotoxicity or enzyme inhibition-mediated effects. Further studies will have to clarify whether a threshold could be established and whether effects do not occur at therapeutic dose levels. Genotoxicity data on the mixed group of anthraquinones reveal positive and negative findings. Compounds such as lucidin, danthron, emodin supposedly have a genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. Further studies with anthraquinone-containing plant preparations will have to clarify the content and genotoxic activity of the preparations and the active ingredients. Lucidin- and danthron-containing preparations are currently no longer in use now whereas restrictions apply for other anthraquinone-containing laxatives. Griseofulvin is acknowledged in the meantime as an aneugen for somatic and germ cells. It is in vitro effective in concentrations that correspond to therapeutic plasma levels.",
        "Biomaterials are used in prostheses and medical devices for different purposes. Polymers are the most diverse class of biomaterials. All biomaterials must meet certain criteria and regulatory requirements before they can be qualified for use in medical applications. Biocompatibility is one of the most important requirements. Both nondegradable polymers are designed to degrade in vivo in a controlled manner over a predetermined time. The main mechanism of in vivo degradation of polymers is 'hydrolytic degradation', in which enzymes may also play a role (i.e. 'enzymatic degradation'). Both natural e.g., collagen, and synthetic e.g., poly(alpha-hydroxy) acids, biodegradable polymers are used in biomedical applications. Many of the current polymers and processing techniques need to be improved in order to produce polymers with better performance in biological media. An important trend in related research and development is the synthesis of novel polymers, which would exhibit improved biocompatibility, and be bioresponsive.",
        "A significant amount of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is now being performed using surgical video systems (SVSs), and with the increased application and sales of SVS equipment, many new SVS manufacturers and products have entered the medical device market. Consequently, the challenge of selecting an appropriate SVS has increased significantly, in part because of the complexity of the latest generation of equipment, which has evolved from solely optical endoscopes to mostly video electronics used with various types of endoscopes. When describing their products, manufacturers often present technical characteristics of their systems that can be complex and, many times, confusing. Although purchasers often rely on technical specifications when selecting an SVS, they actually need information that will illustrate the system's applicability in their clinical setting, which can be assessed only through clinical evaluation at the hospital. Also, the lack of standardized methods of specifying SVS performance and the difficulties in relating technical characteristics to clinical performance should diminish the emphasis that is often placed on specifications when selecting a system. In this article, we review and explain many common specifications of SVSs, focusing on their use with laparoscopes, and provide guidance on the limitations of each specification and the extent to which it may be useful. This information will help clinical engineers, biomedical technicians, and other readers participate in the technical aspects of selecting and managing an SVS for use with many types of endoscopes.",

Increased knowledge of latex allergies is critical to physicians and health care personnel to help avoid these potentially catastrophic emergencies.",
        "New medical device technologies designed to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease are being introduced at an ever increasing pace. Cardiovascular nurses should analyze each new technology before initiating a change in practice. A thorough review and critique of the literature pertaining to the new technology should be made, with particular emphasis on: 1) evaluating if there is a true clinical need for this product; 2) whether the implementation of the new technology will improve patient outcome; and 3) whether there is a real cost/risk/benefit justification. The product development process is briefly reviewed as a framework for understanding the goals of the development process and how these goals may or may not relate to information relevant to evaluation for a change in practice. Newly developed continuous cardiac output catheters are presented as an example for the critique process. There are significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the impact of cardiac output (both intermittent and continuous) on patient outcome, providing extensive opportunities for nursing research.",

After 5 days the colony forming units developing on, and attaching to them were determined. The highest numbers of bacteria were observed on rubber and silicon rubber, polyethylene was next in order, while significantly lower values were obtained on teflon and on tygon and polypropylene. Rubber devices were better colonized after heat than after UV sterilization. The number of bacteria rose further, if the already used rubber implant was resterilized, recontaminated and reimplanted. The model seems suitable to test the development of bacterial biofilms on different materials pretreated in different manners.",

Parallel, the sensitivities of planktonic phase organisms were also determined using cells grown in broth. The biofilm mode of growth strongly reduced the sensitivity of the strains against most of the antibiotics used, especially against polymyxin B. On the other hand, beta-lactam type antibiotics were equally effective against bacteria both in the sessile and planktonic phase of growth.",

        "To prevent the occupational transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne infections in health care settings, guidelines have been issued as universal precautions and body substance isolation. Patient testing has also been advocated. The literature on the compliance to and effectiveness of these measures was reviewed and analyzed to establish the state of knowledge and make appropriate recommendations to improve guidelines. It showed that workers' compliance to recommended measures is relatively poor. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of universal precautions and body substance isolation remain to be demonstrated. Testing patients for HIV infection and other bloodborne pathogens does not appear to be a more appropriate solution. Focus should be placed on preventing parenteral exposures and applying risk assessment methods to identify health care settings and procedures at higher risk. These measures would allow safer medical devices to be targeted and would ensure that financial resources would be available to implement appropriate preventive measures.",

        "This study attempted to determine the effect of unreported patient deaths on estimates of pacemaker reliability.\nThe reliability of pacemakers is usually reported with reference to implant registration data and returned product analysis without censoring when follow-up data are missing.\nWe studied 73 patients (mean [+/- SD] age 77 +/- 8 years) undergoing implantation of a ventricular-inhibited (VVI) pacemaker who were subsequently found to be at increased risk of experiencing premature pacemaker failure. Survival curves for patients and pacemakers were constructed by the Kaplan-Meier method with appropriate censoring at the time of unrelated death or elective explantation of a normal device. To examine the effect of unreported loss of follow-up data, patient mortality was then ignored, and follow-up for pacemakers without known failure was assumed to continue to the date of analysis.\nThere were 13 device failures, with a median pacemaker survival time of 37 months. Twenty-three patients died, all of causes unrelated to the pacemaker system; median patient survival time was only 44 months. Ignoring this attrition inflated follow-up time from 122 to 188 patient-years and reduced the apparent pacemaker failures at 30 months by almost half, from 37% to only 20%. Modeling the process shows that when the patient mortality rate is more than half the pacemaker failure rate, ignoring censoring inflates the device survival estimate by > or = 10% from the median survival onward.\nWhen medical device survival curves are generated by implant registration data and returned product analysis, they should be adjusted for unreported loss of follow-up.",

        "The surfaces of medical devices may promote both coagulation and infections caused by adherent microorganisms. In the case of polymeric elastomers, these iatrogenic effects are likely intermediated by absorbed host proteins that spontaneously bind to the device surface, promoting both bacterial adherence and thrombotic events. We earlier attempted to produce biomaterial surfaces that would selectively bind host albumin because albumin-coated surfaces were known to diminish both coagulation and bacterial adherence. To this end, an albumin-binding high molecular weight dextran:Cibacron blue adduct was bulk incorporated into polyetherurethane (Keogh et al., J Biomed Mater Res 1992;26:441). The modified material bound albumin selectively and reversibly and showed evidence of enhanced biocompatibility. However, approximately 30% of the surface of this material was evidently unmodified and still capable of exerting the above adverse effects. In the present work, we have covalently surface-modified polyetherurethane with sequential additions of acrylamide, amino-propylmethacrylamide, dextran, and Cibacron blue. This derivatized polyurethane preferentially and reversibly binds albumin, even from complex mixtures of proteins such as plasma. Furthermore, this material inhibits the clotting of nonanticoagulated whole human blood (for > 16 hours at room temperature), perhaps by virtue of binding and activation of antithrombin III by the sulfonic acid residues on the surface-immobilized Cibacron blue. Finally, such surfaces, especially when bearing bound albumin, diminish the adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a pathogen frequently associated with device-centered infections. We conclude that similar albumin-affinity surfaces may hold promise for the development of more biocompatible materials for implantation and blood contact applications.",

        "Bacterial infections associated with indwelling medical devices often demonstrate an intrinsic resistance to antimicrobial therapies. In order to explore the possibility of transport limitation to biofilm bacteria as a contributing factor, the penetration of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, ciprofloxacin, through Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms was investigated. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR/FT-IR) spectrometry was employed to monitor bacterial colonization of a germanium substratum, transport of ciprofloxacin to the biofilm-substratum interface, and interaction of biofilm components with the antibiotic in a flowing system. Transport of the antibiotic to the biofilm-substratum interface during the 21-min exposure to 100 micrograms/ml was found to be significantly impeded by the biofilm. Significant changes in IR bands of the biofilm in regions of the spectrum associated with RNA and DNA vibrational modes appeared following exposure to the antibiotic, indicating chemical modification of biofilm components. These results suggest that transport limitations may be an important factor in the antimicrobial resistance of biofilm bacteria and that ATR/FT-IR spectrometry may be used to follow the time course of antimicrobial action in biofilms in situ.",

Hospitals provided the corresponding number of devices used annually for each needle type.\nNumber of needlestick injuries by type of hollow-bore needle per 100,000 devices used per year.\nA total of 2524 injuries from hollow-bore needles were reported. Disposable syringes/hypodermic needles accounted for 59.3% of injuries, followed by winged steel needles (33.1%), intravenous catheter stylets (5.4%), and vacuum-tube phlebotomy needles (2.2%). Intravenous catheter stylets had the highest needlestick injury rate (15.7/100,000 devices used), and disposable syringes had the lowest needlestick injury rate (3.8/100,000). In contrast to the other devices, the injury rate from winged steel needles increased from 6.2 per 100,000 in 1990 to 13.9 per 100,000 in 1992.\nThe device-specific needlestick injury rates in Italy are similar to those reported in the United States, suggesting similar exposure experience in two countries. However, in contrast to the United States, needleless intravenous access is standard practice in Italy and thus eliminates one potential risk to Italian health workers.

        "During the research and development process many similar chemicals or materials may be synthesized that accomplish the required task. The most promising examples then have to be selected for further development. This is primarily achieved by assessing performance in function tests. Where relative toxicity is important, cytotoxicity testing is an effective way of further ranking the potential products. Though cytotoxicity cannot be used to predict precisely in vivo toxicity, used in this fashion it can be successfully incorporated into the selection procedures of a product research and development programme. Four applications of cytotoxicity testing in an industrial research environment will be discussed. Primary screening of metal complexes for potential antitumour activity by evaluating selective cytotoxicity against a panel of human tumour-derived cell lines. The cytotoxicity of a class of novel gold-phosphine complexes with antibacterial activity was assessed against the CHO cell line in order to select compounds with a favourable in vitro therapeutic index. The VERO cell line was used to assess the cytotoxicity of a number of AgCl/TiO(2) compositions with antibacterial activity as part of a biomaterials programme designed to produce materials suitable for incorporation into medical devices. Cytotoxicity against the CHO cell line was used to select possible components for new liquid gold compositions for application to ceramic materials.",

No universally accepted performance standards are available to compare the capabilities of the available air cleaners. These units are classified as household appliances, not as medical devices. Clinical studies have failed to substantiate a significant impact of air cleaners on patients' symptoms. Air cleaners should be used when it is desirable to further reduce airborne contaminant concentrations that are not eliminated by other environmental control measures. Air cleaners should not be the primary means of improving indoor air quality.",
        "Several glucose sensors have been developed, but none are commercially available. The most urgent in vivo problem is the drift of glucose sensor output with time, which may be caused by leakage or denaturation of glucose oxidase, and events at the body-sensor interface such as protein coating, encapsulation with cells, toxicity of the device and inflammation. In the present study, a specific immune response against the outer cellulose acetate membrane of a glucose sensor implanted into rats has also been proved. The immune response against polymeric membranes can be confirmed by detection of specific immunoglobulin G antibodies to cellulose acetate, polyurethane and regenerated cellulose after implantation of the respective membrane. The individually different antibody formation against polymers in rats was amplified by one application of complete Freund's adjuvant in combination with the first implantation. The cell culture results using the fibroblast cell line L-929 showed only a minor toxicity of regenerated cellulose, whereas the other polymers had no effect on cell growth and viability. From the results of this study, it is proposed to integrate immunogenicity as a further parameter for evaluation of the biocompatibility and biosafety of materials or medical devices which are provided for implantation.",
        "Coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia and infections of prosthetic medical devices have become major clinical problems. Efforts to differentiate contaminating from infecting isolates consume the time of microbiology laboratory personnel; decisions over when and with what to institute therapy for multiresistant isolates consume the energy of clinicians; and the need to institute expensive parenteral antimicrobial therapy consumes the hospital pharmacy budget. It is clear that the increased incidence of coagulase-negative staphylococcal infections is the result of medical progress and is due to the use of invasive and indwelling medical devices. Multiresistant organisms have evolved that will survive in the presence of antimicrobial agents designed to eradicate more traditional pathogens. They have an ecological niche on human skin from which they are difficult to eradicate, and they have adapted themselves to survive on inert devices designed to persist indefinitely in the human body. Since it is likely that the use of prosthetic medical devices will continue to increase, we need to device innovative strategies for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infections of these indwelling foreign bodies. Studies that will address these issues should be a major goal of future research on hospital-acquired infections.",

Silicone is not inert. Silicone from breast implants \"bleeds\" through the surrounding envelope and is present in the surrounding capsule or migrates to other distant locations.

        "Fleroxacin, ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and gentamicin were comparatively evaluated for effectiveness in treating experimentally induced catheter-associated urinary tract infection and bacteriuria in a rabbit model with a closed drainage system. Fleroxacin, ampicillin and gentamicin effectively eliminated a lactose-negative, streptomycin-resistant uropathogenic strain of Escherichia coli (WE6933) from bag urine and catheter port urine, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole only marginally reduced urine bacterial counts when compared to rabbits that received no antibiotic therapy. Fleroxacin eliminated E. coli from the catheter surfaces and from tissues adjacent to the catheter. Ampicillin or gentamicin therapy also eliminated biofilm bacteria from the catheter surfaces, but did not eliminate th residual bacteria from tissue adjacent to the septic catheters despite achieving urine levels of antibiotics substantially higher than minimum bactericidal concentrations for this pathogen. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was ineffective in eliminating E. coli from the catheter surfaces and the adjacent tissues. The ability of fleroxacin to effectively eliminate biofilm bacteria from catheter surfaces and tissues adjacent to such medical devices in the urinary tract may prove useful in the treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection and bacteriuria in mammals and humans.",
        "Many materials used in the medical device industry were not originally developed for these applications. In general, these materials elicit adverse biologic responses when in contact with body fluids such as blood, and the mechanisms of the response of blood to an artificial surface are well characterized. Protein adsorption, platelet adhesion, and activation of the coagulation pathway can subsequently lead to thrombus formation with grave clinical consequences in the absence of anticoagulant. However, the use of anticoagulants can result in complications. In recent years various approaches for overcoming these problems by improvement of the biocompatibility of materials have been advocated. One approach is that of biomembrane mimicry, whereby the surface of a material is coated with a derivative of phosphorylcholine (PC). PC is the major lipid head group component found in the outer surface of biologic cell membranes. In this paper, the application of PC coatings to a range of materials is discussed together with characterization of the surfaces using in vitro biocompatibility tests. Studies of fibrinogen and platelet binding have shown significant reductions in adsorption of these components to various PC coated materials relative to uncoated controls. Materials tested, amongst others, include PVC, polyethylene, polycarbonate, and nylon. The stability of the PC coatings has been studied using radiolabeled derivatives. Results using several materials show that physiadsorbed PC coatings are extremely stable, thus making the coatings suitable for use in a wide variety of medical applications. Extensive biologic evaluations to assess the toxicologic profile of PC derivatives and coated devices have also been carried out and in all tests the materials have been shown to be nontoxic, thus making them suitable for human use. Ex vivo animal and human studies performed support the in vitro data.",

When having a blocked nose one realizes the importance of being able to breathe through the nose. By moving the nasal wings aside with the fingers, or the medical device Nozovent, most people experience that it is easier to breathe through the nose than ever before, which can also be shown with rhinomanometry. When it is easier to inhale there is less energy in the air passing the palate which means less risk for vibrations creating snoring sounds. In different studies it has been possible to show that snoring can be decreased or prevented when the nasal dilator Nozovent is used. It has also been shown to result in a decrease of the sleep apnoea index and improvement of arterial oxygen saturation during sleep apnoea.",
        "On January 26, 1994, FDA issued a Safety Alert to directors of emergency medical services (EMS) and emergency healthcare provider organizations concerning automated external defibrillators (AEDs) manufactured by Laerdal Manufacturing Corp. The Safety Alert listed problems with three different Laerdal AED models: 1. Heartstart 1000 (Laerdal's fully automated unit): Failure to recognize and treat ventricular fibrillation. FDA did not provide a recommendation to prevent this problem, but requested that any deaths, serious injuries, or serious illnesses involving Laerdal defibrillators (or other devices) be reported. 2. Heartstart 1000s (a semiautomated version of the 1000): Delivery of a second, unnecessary shock after a normal sinus rhythm had been restored by a first shock. FDA recommended that users of this model check the patient for evidence of a pulse and breathing before allowing the machine to deliver a second or repeated shocks. 3. Heartstart 3000: Keypad malfunction, faulty battery connection, and defective optocoupler components. Other than recommending that all defibrillators, regardless of type or brand, be tested at the beginning of each shift and that they undergo all periodic maintenance recommended by the manufacturer, FDA did not provide specific recommendations to address these problems.\nECRI has several concerns with the FDA's Safety Alert: It does not adequately characterize the frequency or severity of the problems listed and provides a specific recommendation for only one. The specific recommendation provided for the Heartstart 1000s instructs EMS systems using this model to abandon established, successful practices and to adopt a new procedure that contradicts the American Heart Association's (AHA) protocol for AED use and could cause confusion and an increased risk of operator shock. It has caused enough concern that some EMS systems have taken Laerdal AEDs out of service or have hesitated to place new units into service. Unless alternative defibrillators are used, this will prevent patients from receiving the potentially lifesaving therapy of early defibrillation and can lead to unnecessary loss of life. The FDA Safety Alert is intended to raise the awareness of safe and effective use of medical devices; it does not have the force of law.",

        "Copper is a ubiquitous metal in the environment, it is a component of dental casting gold alloys and dental amalgams, and it is a main component in some intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs). Since copper materials implanted in the human body corrode and release ions into the surrounding tissue, the potential toxicity caused by contact of this metal with bodily fluids needs to be evaluated. We implanted male Wistar rats with osmotic mini pumps that continuously administered saline, CuCl2, or a copper chelate, cupric nitrilotriacetate (Cu-NTA), at a rate of 4 mg copper/kg body wt/day. This experimental design maintained serum copper concentrations at a level 30-70% (CuCl2) or 100-120% (Cu-NTA) higher than in untreated controls. At different times postimplantation, we measured the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in DNA of kidney, liver, and tissue surrounding the pump implant, since production of 8-OHdG has been associated with mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. Hepatic and renal levels of 8-OHdG in CuCl2- or Cu-NTA-treated animals were significantly higher than in control animals. In contrast, histopathologic changes in kidneys and livers of rats exposed to CuCl2 and Cu-NTA were limited to mild changes involving hepatic focal necrosis and slightly increased mitotic activity in the renal proximal tubules. These observations suggest that levels of 8-OHdG could be an early marker of copper toxicity. It is unlikely that the high levels of copper at which we observed DNA modification will be encountered after occupational or environmental exposure. A different situation could be found around medical devices that include copper, particularly IUDs, where the amount of copper administered in our experiments could be released in the uterus of women after a few months of continued IUD use.",

The first 2 patients were treated according to Food and Drug Administration guidelines (\"Emergency Use of Unapproved Medical Devices,\" October 22, 1985), and the remaining 9 were treated according to an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). The goal of the study was to establish the short-term safety of ELAD therapy, with a focus on acute medical complications such as hemodynamic instability, complement activation, and deterioration of vital organ function. As secondary goals, the metabolic capacity of ELAD cartridges and their clinical impact were assessed. Treatment was considered successful if the patient recovered sufficient liver function to survive weaning from the ELAD or was stabilized until orthotopic liver transplantation was performed. No short-term safety problems were associated with ELAD use. In addition, metabolic support was documented in 10 of the 11 patients, and 6 patients reached a successful end-point. The Hepatix ELAD is safe, and it provides measurable metabolic support in patients with late-stage liver failure.

For this reason, a study of different rechargeable lithium and nickel/cadmium (Ni/Cd) battery cell types was undertaken to determine which cell type, when assembled into a multicell battery pack, would provide the smallest and lightest power source for implantation. The discharge rate and cycle life characteristics of 2 different rectangular prismatic Ni/Cd cells and 5 different rechargeable lithium cells were determined at 37 degrees C by charge/discharge cycling, the cells using a constant discharge load of 0.87 A. Using the observed discharge rate and cycle life characteristics of the cells, along with the desired performance criteria of 30 min operating time at the end of a 1-year implant period, the projected weight and volume of the various 12-V battery packs were determined. These results showed that one of the rectangular prismatic Ni/Cd cells would yield the smallest (53 ml) and lightest (189 g) 12-V battery pack that met the performance criteria specified. The results also indicate that, for applications requiring long implant times, cycle life can be more important in the selection of cells for a small, lightweight battery pack than specific energy or energy density.",

        "In an earlier work, slightly more than 650 plastic materials, intended for use in medical devices, were tested with a battery of chemical, as well as in vitro and in vivo biological tests. An analysis showed that only a limited number of the tests used were actually necessary to obtain the same pass or fail decision as that obtained using the full test battery. This prompted us to prescreen all new materials with a small test battery consisting of the two most discriminating chemical tests and an in vitro cell growth inhibition test. The present work is a report of our findings after testing another 155 materials using this prescreen system. For each single one of the 155 tested materials the same decision on whether or not to use the material in the intended medical device would have been reached without any in vivo testing. In no single case in a total of 851 in vivo tests did an eluate that had passed the in vitro cell test give rise to a reaction in vivo. Thus, among the tests on living systems, the cell test alone seems to be sensitive enough to provide sufficient information. Nothing appears to be gained from the in vivo animal tests. However, some of the materials that passed the prescreening tests later failed in one or several of the chemical tests. Both nonspecific chemical tests and tests for specific molecules seem to detect undesirable levels of leachable substances not detected by the prescreening system. Therefore these tests should not be abandoned. Abandoning unnecessary in vivo testing, on the other hand, would save considerable costs.",

The binding of teicoplanin to specimen vessel surfaces was, on average, four times greater than that of vancomycin and was particularly marked with silconized polymers (5.2 micrograms/cm2). Pre-exposure of a polymer surface to human body fluids caused a 60% reduction in teicoplanin binding. Reduction of the negative surface charge on a polymer surface with ferric nitrate resulted in a ten-fold increase in teicoplanin binding. The accumulation of a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis on silicone rubber catheter segments pre-exposed to glycopeptide antibiotics was examined. In phosphate buffered saline binding of bacteria to vancomycin-treated polymer was greater than to an unexposed control surface. In contrast, in human serum both antibiotics caused reductions in adherent growth. The binding of glycopeptide antibiotics, in particular teicoplanin, to polymer surfaces may interfere with the results of in-vitro assays. However, this phenomenon may be useful in the prevention of bacterial accumulation on the surfaces of medical devices.",
        "\"Truth is the essence of science,\" and \"peer review\" is a key element in assuring the \"truth\". Peer review is particularly important with regard to diagnostic pathology in bioassays used for regulatory purposes and approval of drugs and medical devices for at least 2 reasons: (a) If a study is designed correctly and conducted properly, the bottom-line results rely almost entirely on pathological interpretations, and (b) diagnostic pathology is a subjective science that relies on the training and experience of the pathologist and therefore is subject to individual bias. \"Bias\" can be introduced during the collection and preparation of pathological materials, use of inconsistent terminology during the pathology evaluation and interpretation of the results. Peer review can help in reducing this bias. However, peer review is also subject to bias by knowledge of treatment groups, selection of inappropriate slides for review, in the type of question asked of the reviewers, and in the selection of the reviewers. When done correctly, pathology peer review can be an effective and important part of a process to assure the results of a study, but when done improperly it can cloud the issue and have a negative impact on the credibility of the study.",
        "Blood biocompatibility of medical devices is in many ways dependent on surface characteristics and biochemical blood material interactions. In this study, the contact system, in which the activation of factor XII and plasma kallikrein is included, is highlighted. This article describes a simple chromogenic assay to determine the Hageman Factor fragment (HFf, or factor XIIf) and kallikrein activity in vitro. The assay is based on conversion of Z-Lys-Phe-Arg-pNA.2HCl to which human factor XIIf and kallikrein appeared to have a high affinity. To discriminate between the serine proteases factor XIIf and kallikrein to cleave this substrate, aprotinin was added to one of two complementary samples. In this in vitro study, standardized disks from glass, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polytetrafluoro ethylene (PTFE), and polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) were studied for their capacity to generate factor XIIf and kallikrein in plasma. Kaolin was used as positive control. On glass disks the highest and on HDPE the lowest generation of factor XIIf and kallikrein were found, both with a ratio of 1:1. On PDMS and on PTFE disks protease activities were intermediate, but with a factor XIIf and kallikrein activity ratio of 1:2 and 1:4, respectively. Apparently because of the hydrophobic surface character of PDMS and PTFE, these surfaces absorb or fail to produce the factor XIIf. This assay appeared to be discriminative even for materials that are considered mild activators of the contact system and can therefore be used as a standard method to qualify biomaterials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Medical devices marketed in the United States must satisfy FDA standards of safety and effectiveness. Many observers have criticized the FDA medical device review process as both time consuming and unpredictable. In this note, Lawrence Makow examines the Agency's treatment of two novel medical technologies, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and biliary extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. He concludes that the outcomes of these cases exemplify the mismatch between clinical utility and FDA approval status that has prompted concerns about lack of predictability. Mr. Makow asserts that this mismatch results from the FDA's implementation of the medical device statute rather than from the statute itself. He proposes an asymmetric standard for evaluating the safety and efficacy of new medical devices. While the safety showing would always require a high burden of proof, the efficacy standard would vary depending on the relationship between the device's safety and efficacy. Under this asymmetric standard, the FDA could better manage its workload and achieve more predictable results without sacrificing the public interest in avoiding injury from unproven medical devices.",

Consideration should be given at the start of the development process to the particular requirements of the project and the project should be structured to ensure that the specific functional requirements for security are satisfied. In addition the development process itself must be conducted in a rigorous fashion in order to ensure-and to demonstrate--that the end product has the appropriate degree of 'correctness'.

        "The breast implant issue is a \"bad news/good news\" story. For many women with implants, the controversy has caused a fair degree of anxiety which may or may not be resolved as further information becomes available. It has also taken its toll on Dow Corning. Whole lines of medical products have been eliminated or are being phase out. The development of new medical applications has been terminated. As a consequence, employees have lost their jobs. What the effect will be on the biomedical industry as a whole remains to be seen (11). While silicones have been an important component in various medical devices, it is likely that other materials can be used as replacements. However, suppliers of non-silicone materials are also reevaluating their role in this market. For example, Du Pont, the nation's largest chemical company, has determined that the unpredictable and excessive costs of doing business with manufacturers of implantable medical devices no longer justifies the unrestricted sale of standard raw materials into this industry. Other companies are quietly following suit. On the up side, it is possible that the research being driven by this controversy will result in a greater understanding of the immunologic implications of xenobiotics, of the importance of nonbiased observations, of the need for ready access to valid data sets, and of the opportunity for valid scientific information to guide legal decisions.

        "Common to most of the health care reform proposals currently under consideration in the US Congress is an emphasis on preventive services such as well-baby visits.  The Clinton plan, formally known as the Health Security Act (HSA), would exempt preventive care from the deductibles and co-payments applicable to other covered health care services.  A weakness of the HSA is its failure to regard the reproductive health benefits package as preventive.  Although prenatal and postpartum care are classified as such, family planning visits and other services for pregnant women are subject to deductibles and cost-sharing stipulations for recipients with incomes above the poverty level.   Also problematic is the HSA's failure to define the scope of services beyond \"voluntary family planning services\" and medical devices subject to federal approval.  This ambiguity leaves the status of abortion unclear, and implies that drugs, such as oral contraceptives, are not covered.  Thus, a woman who attends a family planning clinic to obtain a prescription for oral contraceptives could be required to meet deductibles both for medical visits and outpatient prescription drugs. Similarly, the HSA makes no mention of sexually transmitted diseases prevention.  Instead, coverage is provided for \"fertility related infectious illness\"--a stipulation that enables annual screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia but excludes syphilis.  Managed care providers who receive a flat fee regardless of the amount of care provided might be inclined to eliminate screening for all sexually transmitted diseases.  Also of concern is the threat that low-income women who currently receive free prenatal medical care through Medicaid would be required to pay a share of their premiums to receive HSA coverage for other areas.  The extension of Medicaid benefits to pregnant women with incomes up to 185% of the poverty level substantially increased use of prenatal care by the working poor--a trend that would be reversed under the terms of the HSA.",

        "Implementation of the Safe Medical Devices Act (SMDA) by a \"medical device user facility\" requires the introduction of new responsibilities, processes, and accountabilities. The complexity of a program will vary with the number of devices included, as well as the medical activities of the particular facility. The implementation of the SMDA is described in a 145-bed, acute care, county hospital, along with some of the practical problems and solutions associated with its implementation. Both the event reportability section and the tracking section of SMDA have been implemented. The greatest difficulty in the event reportability section lies in the ambiguous definitions that determine event reportability. This ambiguity may be clarified when the final regulations are published. In respect to device tracking, questions remain unanswered that relate to the manufacturer-facility interface and disposition of explanted devices.",

        "Renal biopsy is a technically difficult procedure in children. Some centers are still using general anesthesia, fluoroscopy, and/or open renal biopsies in young infants. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of two different types of 18-gauge, automated, spring-loaded disposable biopsy needles in 43 children, aged 8 months to 16 years, under ultrasound guidance. Microinvasive ASAP18 (Boston Scientific Corp, Watertown, MA) needles retrieve 19-mm long specimens only, while Ultra-Cut needles (Medical Device Technologies, Inc, Gainesville, FL) are adjustable and can retrieve 6-, 13-, or 19-mm specimens. Technically, Ultra-Cut needles are easier to use in infants or when small kidneys are biopsied. While two infants required intravenous ketamine, the remaining biopsies were done with intravenous sedation. Ultrasound-guided renal biopsy with 18-gauge microinvasive needles and intravenous sedation is a safe and reliable method for obtaining biopsy specimens in older children, as well as in small infants.",
        "A number of portable medical devices, including the implantable ventricular assist device, demand fluctuating or pulsatile power from their batteries. Therefore, a study was undertaken to determine the effects of these pulsatile discharge loads on the cycle life and operating time of rectangular prismatic nickel/cadmium battery cells. The battery cells were charge/discharge cycled at 37 degrees C using either a pulsatile discharge load of 10.0 or 11.25 W (average) or a nonpulsatile discharge load equivalent to the average of the pulsatile loads. The tests showed that the pulsatile discharged cells gave significantly less operating time throughout their cycle life, by a mean of 3 +/- 3-8 +/- 2 min on each cycle (ie, 8 +/- 8-18 +/- 5%), compared to the cells under equivalent nonpulsatile discharge loads. The tests also showed that the pulsatile discharged cells had significantly shorter cycle lives, by 61-97 cycles (11-17%), than the nonpulsatile discharged cells. The results show that, under the test conditions of this study, pulsatile discharge loads reduce the cycle lives and operating times of rectangular prismatic nickel/cadmium battery cells, compared to cells discharged under nonpulsatile loads of equivalent average power.",

Lack of compliance may carry civil and criminal penalties in the future, affect liability and risk management, and influence accreditation.",
        "Single strand breaks of DNA of peripheral mononuclear blood cells from 97 male and female workers occupationally exposed to ethylene oxide were analysed by the alkaline elution method. These individuals were occupied with the sterilization of medical devices in hospitals and in commercial plants. Ethylene oxide in the air of the working areas was detected up to a maximal concentration of 16.5 mg/m3 calculated as 4-h time-weighted average (4h TWA). Mean value was 1.47 +/- 0.52 mg/m3 (1 mg/m3 = 0.55 ppm). Compared to the mean elution rate of the DNA from non-smoking workers exposed to air concentrations of ethylene oxide below the detection limit of 0.1 mg/m3 (4h TWA) the non-smokers working in rooms with a concentration of ethylene oxide between 0.5 mg/m3 and 2 mg/m3 showed a statistically significant (P < 0.05) 119% higher mean elution rate and even for the non-smokers exposed to 0.1-0.5 mg/m3 of ethylene oxide a statistically significant (P < 0.05) 53% higher mean elution rate was observed. For smokers a similar tendency was found but the increase in elution rates in response to the external exposure was smaller than in non-smokers and no statistical significance was obtained. According to their sensitivity to ethylene oxide the non-smoking workers could be classified into two subpopulations. In the majority of the non-smokers (67%) approximately 5-fold more DNA strand breaks were induced by ethylene oxide than in the other non-smokers. A lowest detectable effect level could only be specified for non-smokers. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
        "Complement is a principal mediator of the acute inflammatory response and contributes to the non-specific recognition and elimination of foreign substances from the body. The system evolved to protect the host from invasion by various pathogens. However, due to the non-selective nature of the alternative pathway, biomaterial surfaces in any medical device used in contact with blood will also activate the system. This review summarizes our current understanding of the biochemistry and cell biology of complement. The relationship of this basic information to clinical observations is discussed in order to affirm the relevance of complement as a critical parameter of biocompatibility.",

The bacterial glycocalyx is a major mediator of attachment of these organisms to medical devices, but the glycocalyx is sometimes difficult to demonstrate. A combination of the techniques of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and image analysis enabled investigators to reveal the glycocalyx which was previously indiscernible. Eight strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. hominis, S. lugdunensis, and S. schleiferi subspecies schleiferi, were grown, treated with anti-staphylococcal serum to stabilize the glycocalyx, and examined by TEM. Image analysis of negatives was then used to enhance the visual images which showed far more glycocalyx than previously seen by TEM alone.",
        "The scope of application of ethical principles in health communication is discussed with particular reference to the influence of the mass media on people's perceptions of benefit and risk in the field of health care.\nCommunication involves the interchange of information between message recipients and professionals and the mass media.  Health communication should adhere to the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for personal autonomy, and justice.  The exchange between health professionals and patients should involve informed consent regarding the purpose and nature of the intervention and possible alternatives.  There should be respect, freedom from intimidation, and suitable language understandable to patients.  Pubic health information effectively communicated must be clear and complete, but not necessarily exhaustive.  Complex explanations must be balanced by the ability of the public to comprehend and by informative detail that does not overload the public. Complex issues of benefit and risk, screening for disease, and risk factors must be carefully handled to avoid misunderstanding and misrepresentation.  Cultural conceptions must be respected, even when there is no scientific basis in fact.  Resolution may be necessary between the interests of individuals and the interests of society. Scientific information must be placed in context and information not withheld for journalists; for example, it would be misleading to not mention that the study and results on lung cancer were funded by the Tobacco Industry.  Mass media presentation of scientific information must be accurate, clear, accountable, honest, and decent.  Readers should be considered as capable of making rational decisions based on true, accurate, and sufficient information.  Sources should be checked for reputation of the individual and reliability.  Complete candor and full sets of information should be given to the press, even though in some cases the physician may not tell the patient the whole truth. Impairment in people's ability to make informed decisions may occur with too many reports of beneficial treatments, neglect of risky treatments, and overstatement of risks associated with drugs and medical devices. Essential advice can be ignored, when excessive health information is provided.  Benefits to some and risks to many must be balanced. Communication that respects the autonomy of individuals is ethically distinct from campaigning communication aimed at sensationalizing. Ethics controls are written into law in some countries; perhaps an international code for communication in public information on health should be developed.",

        "Ambulatory anesthesia has become recognized as an anesthetic subspecialty, with formal postgraduate training programs. With increasing clinical experience, it is possible to determine which patients will derive the greatest clinical benefit from ambulatory surgery. Further expansion of the specialty of ambulatory anesthesia and surgery is likely to occur in the near future. The rate of expansion of ambulatory anesthesia will probably vary from country to country, depending on local needs, the level and availability of ancillary home health-care services, and economic considerations. Many recently developed drugs have pharmacological profiles that make them ideally suited for use in the ambulatory setting. Although these new drugs are valuable additions to the anesthesiologist's armamentarium, their cost is obviously higher than the drugs they were designed to replace. Given the changing pattern of health-care reimbursement, it is incumbent upon all practitioners to carefully examine the impact of new drugs and techniques on the quality of ambulatory anesthesia. It is obvious that these more rapid and shorter-acting anesthetic, analgesic, and muscle relaxant drugs have facilitated the early recovery process, thereby allowing our surgical colleagues to perform more extensive surgical procedures on an ambulatory basis. Future studies of new drugs and techniques for ambulatory anesthesia need to focus not only on subjective improvements for the patient during the perioperative period, but also on the overall cost-effectiveness of the care provided. These studies must compare the increased cost of new treatments with the potential financial savings resulting from earlier hospital discharge, reduced consumption of supplemental drugs, and earlier return to work. Recent pharmacological and technological advances in anesthesia and surgery allow outpatients with complex medical problems to undergo a wide variety of diagnostic and surgical procedures on an ambulatory basis. Increasingly, anesthesia practitioners as well as pharmacy and therapeutic committees are demanding evidence that new drugs and medical devices are superior to existing products--that they work better, have fewer adverse effects, and enhance efficiency, thereby reducing healthcare costs. As new biomedical technology is introduced to facilitate the perioperative management of patients (e.g., computerized anesthesia information management systems), evidence that these systems enhance our ability to provide high-quality, cost-effective health care will assume greater importance. The challenge that all practitioners face is to provide high-quality ambulatory anesthesia care at a reduced cost.",
        "The IEEE has gone to ballot on a \"Standard for Medical Device Communications\", IEEE P1073. The lower layer, hardware portions of the standard are expected to be approved by the IEEE Standards Board at their December 11-13, 1994 meeting. Other portions of the standard are in the initial stages of the IEEE ballot process. The intent of the standard is to allow hospitals and other users to interface medical electronic devices to host computer systems in a standard, interchangeable manner. The standard is optimized for acute care environments such as ICU's, operating rooms, and emergency rooms. [1] IEEE General Committee and Subcommittee work has been on-going since 1984. Significant amounts of work have been done to discover and meet the needs of the patient care setting. Surveys performed in 1989 identified the following four key user requirements for medical device communications: 1) Frequent reconfiguration of the network. 2) Allow \"plug and play\" operation by users. 3) Associate devices with a specific bed and patient. 4) Support a wide range of hospital computer system topologies. Additionally, the most critical difference in the acute care setting is patient safety, which has an overall effect on the standard. The standard that went to ballot meets these requirements. The standard is based on existing ISO standards. P1073 is compliant with the OSI seven layer model. P1073 specifies the entire communication stack, from object-oriented software to hospital unique connectors. The standard will be able to be put forward as a true international standard, much in the way that the IEEE 802.x family of standards (like Ethernet) were presented as draft ISO standards.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The objective was to introduce appropriate functional groups suitable for covalently binding bioactive agents, heparin in particular, through spacer molecules. A new means by which this can be accomplished on the inside surfaces of a long tube is also described. The heparin immobilized surface is nonthrombogenic and this technique can be used to bind heparin to various blood contacting medical devices. The heparinized surfaces were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and static secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SSIMS), before and after extraction in phosphate buffered saline and 4 M guanidine, to confirm the covalent binding of heparin.",
        "The nation's commitment to health cost control will potentially conflict with its deeper commitment to innovation in medical technology--drugs, medical devices, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and administrative infrastructure.

        "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) drug approval process has evolved from a system in which a drug could lawfully be marketed unless the FDA were able to prove that the manufacturer knew that the drug would not work for the conditions for which it was promoted to one in which drug-makers require advance approval from the agency for almost every important step in testing, production, and marketing. The more modern system for regulating medical devices is the product of amendments to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1976. In those amendments, Congress sought to create a framework for control of device technology that would also facilitate innovation. This paper suggests that, notwithstanding this aspiration, both external pressures and internal practices are inexorably bringing device regulation closer to the \"drug model.\"",

The certification of medical devices used in dentistry will be based on European standards which are identical or similar to international (ISO) standards.",
        "Due to the minimal release of compounds from most materials, systemic toxicity effects caused by dental materials have been considered to occur very seldomly or not at all. Screening tests for systemic toxicity are therefore justified only with certain body contact for long periods of time with a dental product. The international standardization on biological evaluation of medical devices has demonstrated a need for improved screening tests and continuous revision of the standards for testing. It is obvious that certain published studies on systemic effects of dental materials and some proposed test methods do not reflect today's demand for toxicokinetic and organ effect studies.",
        "The key determinants of transmission of bloodborne pathogens are the dose and serum viral concentration of an exposure. This conclusion is supported by data showing that the rate of transmission of hepatitis B virus is elevated if the source patient's viral serum concentration is high and by a comparison of serum concentrations and rates of transmission for hepatitis B virus, HIV, and hepatitis C virus: As the mean serum viral concentration of each of these pathogens increases, the rate of transmission also increases. While there is evidence that the incidence of clinical hepatitis B has declined as a result of vaccine-induced immunity, the prevalence of hospital patients who are HBsAg-positive has actually increased. As the AIDS epidemic evolves and increasing numbers of patients with AIDS are hospitalized, the risk of exposure to HIV and hepatitis B virus can be expected to increase further. Thus, health care workers, many of whom work in an urban setting and are exposed to the blood and body fluids of patients, should be required to receive hepatitis B vaccine. Whereas hepatitis B virus transmission can be prevented by immunization of health care workers, controlling hepatitis C virus and HIV will require efforts to reduce the incidence and dosage of exposures to blood and body fluids. These strategies include the design and use of safe medical devices, targeted interventions based on occupation-specific hazards, the use of gloves and other barriers, and ongoing surveillance and analysis of exposures in the health care setting.",
        "Following concern over a suggested link between the implantation of silicone gel and connective tissue disease, the Medical Devices Directorate (MDD) of the Department of Health reviewed all available data for submission to a specially convened Expert Advisory Group. Animal studies indicated that silicones are unlikely to stimulate a specific antibody response or cell-mediated immunity, that they have no adverse effect on resistance to infection, and produce minimal effects in the presence of potent adjuvants but can act as adjuvants themselves. The connective tissue disease most commonly claimed to be associated with breast implants is scleroderma. Although one series of patients showed a significantly higher prevalence of this disease than expected, there is no clear indication that the incidence of scleroderma in women with breast implants is any higher than in the general population.",

In this communication a few comments are added to those of. The medical device safety regulations limit the maximum total input current which can be applied to the human thorax.

        "Accurate detection of middle-ear effusion in children is not only useful but also necessary for diagnosis, management and follow-up of otitis media. A relatively new device, the Acoustic Otoscope (model 101, ENT Medical Devices) has been introduced for detecting middle-ear fluid in children. We tested 158 ears and the diagnosis was confirmed by acoustic admittance, acoustic reflex and pneumatic otoscopy. We propose 4.5 as a better breakpoint (the number on the vertical scale of the instrument which is the lower limit indicating middle-ear effusion) than 4.0 which is proposed by the manufacturer. In our results the 4.5 breakpoint maximizes both positive and negative predictive values (83 and 82% respectively) with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity (86 and 79% respectively) in detection of otitis media. Our clinical experience with this instrument, during the past 2 years, has led us to conclude that it is simple, non-invasive and objective. Unlike tympanometry, it requires no hermetic seal and is effective even if the child is crying. However, it is not sensitive enough when there are bubbles or negative pressure in the middle ear. When the user is aware of the flexibility of the instrument's breakpoints (in our opinion this is an advantage of the device) for different uses and different populations, the reflectometer often reduces the need for tympanometry and confirms the otoscopic examination.",
        "This study investigated the potential of coronary sinus blood temperature to detect ventricular arrhythmias. A rapid-response, thermistor-tipped catheter placed in the coronary venous system of anesthetized dogs was used to record the blood temperature during periods of induced bradycardia, tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. A second catheter was used to measure blood temperature in the aortic arch during these same episodes. A pulsatile component of venous blood temperature, typically 40 m degrees C in amplitude, was well correlated with the cardiac cycle, while another, slightly larger, pulsatile component was well correlated with respiration. The cardiac component peaked during ventricular systole, and the respiratory component peaked during expiration. As compared with sinus rhythm, the cardiac signal diminished during bradycardia and tachycardia and nearly disappeared during asystole and ventricular fibrillation. The baseline component of venous blood temperature rose during periods of tachycardia and fibrillation, while respiration proved to be an important factor in the baseline temperatures. The presence of small, cyclic, thermal variations in the coronary venous system was verified, and the concept of measuring metabolic activity to assess ventricular function was substantiated. These studies show promise that this concept could be incorporated into medical devices that use these temperature signals for diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmias.",
        "Hypersensitivity to natural rubber latex, an ingredient of many medical devices and consumer products, appears to be increasing. Chemical additives induce T-cell mediated type IV delayed reactions while proteins that occur naturally in latex elicit antibody-mediated type I immediate reactions. The latter can be fatal. The clinical manifestations of these reactions, the risk factors for developing latex hypersensitivity, and diagnostic options are reviewed. The only reliable management strategy is allergen avoidance. Therefore, factors that can affect the levels of both type I and type II allergens in products are discussed.\nNatural rubber latex is an ingredient in many medical devices and consumer products.  In some people, however, chemical additives induce T-cell mediated type IV delayed reactions, while proteins occurring naturally in latex elicit antibody-mediated type I immediate reactions. It seems as though the prevalence of hypersensitivity to natural rubber latex is increasing.  Delayed hypersensitivity may occur 4-48 hours after contact with the allergen and involve local redness, swelling, papules, or edema as well as diffuse reactions.  These reactions may lead to permanent tissue damage.  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are potentially fatal and may be likened to reactions in some from bee stings.  Clinical manifestations do, however, vary depending upon a subject's susceptibility to the antigen and the conditions of exposure. More than 80 anaphylactic reactions to natural latex rubber have been reported in the literature, many occurring intraoperatively  Risk factors for developing latex hypersensitivity and diagnostic options are reviewed.  Allergen avoidance being the only reliable management strategy, the authors discuss factors which can affect the levels of both type I and type II allergens in products.",

Increasingly, however, anesthesia practitioners, as well as pharmacy and therapeutic committees, are demanding proof that a new, more costly drug or medical device is superior to existing products in achieving its desired effect, is associated with fewer adverse effects, enhances efficiency, and reduces health care costs. The new field of pharmacoeconomics has emphasized the importance of cost-effectiveness analyses that consider both direct and indirect costs of newer drugs and therapeutic modalities. As new biomedical technology is introduced to facilitate the perioperative management of patients (e.g., computerized anesthesia information management systems), evidence that these systems enhance our ability to continue to provide high-quality, cost-effective health care will assume increasing importance. Limitations in health care resources necessitate a careful reevaluation of our clinical practices with respect to choice of drugs, supplies, equipment, and even discharge criteria. Ambulatory anesthesia and surgery will continue to increase because of the potential cost savings for patients undergoing elective operations on an outpatient basis. However, the challenge we face will be to continue to provide high-quality anesthesia care at a reduced cost. A careful examination of commonly accepted (but unproven) clinical practice patterns will be necessary to meet this challenge.",

        "Direct examination of medical devices that have been foci of chronic device-related bacterial infections has shown that the causative organisms grow predominantly in slime-enclosed biofilms. These adherent biofilms are inherently resistant to host defences (antibodies, phagocytes) and to conventional antibiotic therapy. Device-related infections can be prevented by careful cleaning and sterilization of the device, and by the avoidance of any manipulations that would allow the formation of even the most rudimentary biofilm prior to implantation. Once a device-related infection has become established, both the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Biofilm Eliminating Concentration (BEC) of the causative organism must be determined and therapeutic strategy must aim at the use of the MIC to control the acute phase caused by planktonic bacteria and of the BEC to eliminate the biofilm nidus of infection. The removal of the colonized device should be considered early in the course of treatment if the BEC cannot be delivered to the colonized device. We describe a new bioelectric technology presently in the in vitro stage of development which, if it can be reproduced in vivo, will be very effective in the prevention and control of device-related bacterial infections.",
        "The Intrastromal Corneal Ring (ICR) is a new investigational medical device designed to alter corneal curvature without surgical intervention in the central cornea. The ring is inserted between the layers of the stroma in the cornea's periphery at two-thirds depth through an approximately 2-millimeter incision.\nTo investigate the safety and refractive effect of implanting an ICR of a given thickness (0.30 mm) and outer diameter (7.70 mm) into human corneas, an ICR was implanted into one nonfunctional eye of each of three patients during the period of March to May, 1991. One predesignated ICR was successfully explanted 5 months after implantation to evaluate the feasibility of ICR removal and to observe the effect of ring removal on corneal curvature. Patients were followed for 1 year after the initial implant procedure.\nThe three implant procedures and postoperative courses proceeded without any significant complications. Approximately 2.00 D of central corneal flattening was achieved in all eyes. No adverse reactions or other medically-significant complications were observed over a 1-year follow-up period. The patient who underwent ICR removal experienced no perioperative complications, and the patient's cornea has remained stable with a return to its preoperative curvature.\nAlthough this study is preliminary and limited in scope, we have demonstrated that the ICR can be tolerated safely in the human cornea and results in a flattening of the corneal curvature that is stable for up to a year after insertion. The successful removal of the ICR begins to establish reversibility of the procedure and induced refractive effect.",
        "Increasing attention is being focused on environmental agents as possible factors in the etiology of certain connective tissue disorders. As our awareness in this area increases, the number and diversity of these agents is expanding yearly and now includes, in addition to infectious agents, a variety of foods and dietary supplements, drugs, occupational and other toxic exposures, biologics, and medical devices. Some of these agents have been associated with the development of muscle disease through mechanisms that involve alterations in the vascular supply to muscle, depletion of electrolytes, direct toxic effects on mitochondria or other metabolic processes, or activation of the immune system. Individual host susceptibility factors, including preexisting organ dysfunction and particular metabolizer or immunogenetic phenotypes, also appear to be important for development of the clinical syndromes identified as environmentally associated myopathies. Although data in this area are limited, they suggest that when susceptible individuals are exposed to selected agents, physiologic alterations occur that lead to myopathy. Physician awareness of chemicals implicated with myopathy and dissection of their pathogenetic mechanisms through human and animal studies may aid in the identification of additional toxic agents, minimize new cases in the future, and lead to a better understanding of the idiopathic myopathies.",

Class III devices are the most critical ones, and require a Premarket Approval that includes clinical trials before market introduction. Classes I and II usually require a 510(k), or premarket notification, which usually does not need any clinical data. Testing requirements include biocompatibility testing; physical, functional, and packaging testing; and sterility testing. The continuous spinal catheter (25-32 gauge) was marketed under a 510(k) claiming substantial equivalence to the Bizzarri-Giuffrida 24-gauge catheter, which was a pre-Amendment device.

        "Routine morning chest x-ray films (CXRs) are widely obtained in surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients. During a 1-month time period we prospectively evaluated 525 routine morning CXRs in patients admitted to the SICU of a university trauma center (n = 256) or a suburban affiliate hospital (n = 269) to assess the impact of these CXRs on patient care. All CXRs were read by radiologists. Data on position of medical devices (CVP lines, endotracheal tubes, etc.) and cardiopulmonary (CP) findings were collected. A total of 1028 medical devices were evaluated. Fifty-five (5.4%) were considered to be in a minor incorrect position that did not adversely affect patient care and only 13 (1.3%) devices required repositioning for patient care or safety. Seventy-eight CXRs were read as normal. There were 775 CP findings on the remaining 477 CXRs. When compared with previous CXRs, only 12% (89 of 775) of the findings were considered new, 65% were unchanged, 14% were improved, and 15% demonstrated worsening of a known finding. Of the 89 new CP findings, only three had any potential clinical impact (pneumothorax in two, effusion in one). These data demonstrate an extremely low yield of clinically significant and unsuspected new CP findings or device malposition on the routine morning CXR. We conclude that routine daily chest radiography should be abandoned and that the need for a morning CXR should be based on clinical necessity.",
        "Chronic renal failure is no longer synonymous with death. Federal and state government funding for end stage renal disease (ESRD) services and advances in modern technology now make the prolongation of life possible for almost any individual with renal failure. However, the same medical devices and sources of funding that support renal replacement therapies have also contributed to the moral and ethical debates that surround these treatments. Discussions regarding quality of life, rehabilitation statistics, functional status data, prognosis, decision making protocol, and selection criteria provoke much controversy in the nephrology community and remind us of the \"Death or God Committees\" utilized in the pre-Medicare days to make decisions regarding access to dialysis treatments. In this issue of ANNA Journal, Marguerite Hartigan and Christy Price revisit the issue of selection criteria and explore the advantages and disadvantages of using established protocol to access the services of the ESRD Program and nephrology community.",

        "Registered nurses are primarily responsible for the use of medical devices in direct patient care. This cross-sectional survey compared how and what 139 registered nurses working in a variety of wards/units in a 1000-bed tertiary care hospital in South Australia initially learned about the life-sustaining and non-life-sustaining medical devices they use. Furthermore, the consequences of device use both for patients and staff were explored. How and what registered nurses initially learned about life-sustaining and non-life-sustaining devices were remarkably similar. Consequences of device use, which included increased or decreased quality of care, increased nurse stress and patient harm, were related, in part, to knowledgeable and proficient device use. Thus, device education for nurses is essential and warrants further exploration.",
        "Medical device problems as detected by the Health Protection Branch (HPB) of Health and Welfare Canada were studied in order to examine the frequency and safety priority of problems in the subgroup of anaesthesia devices. Data pertaining to the time period from April 1, 1987 to November 30, 1992 were gathered from the Medical Devices Notification Database and the DAFFY Reporting System. The Medical Devices Notification Database contains all notifications for newly marketed medical devices in Canada and the DAFFY Reporting System keeps record of all submitted problem reports and manufacturer recalls along with their designated safety priority status. When an important safety hazard is associated with a medical device as determined from information submitted to HPB, an Alert-Medical Devices may be issued to inform hospitals and health care professionals of the problem. During the studied time period, the percentages of problem reports and recalls as well as Alerts were compared with the percentage of newly marketed anaesthesia devices. It was found that although only 2.3% of the newly marketed medical devices were classified as anaesthesia devices, 8.6% of all problem reports/recalls and 37.5% of all Alerts originated from the field of anaesthesia devices. Comparison of the percentages of problem reports/recalls (8.6%) and Alerts (37.5%) with the percentage of marketed devices for anaesthesia (2.3%) showed differences (P < 0.05). As well, the percentage of class I priority (the highest safety priority) problem reports/recalls for anaesthesia devices was 10.2% compared with 4.9% for non-anaesthesia devices (P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Blood platelets interact with a variety of soluble agonists such as epinephrine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP); many insoluble cell matrix components, including collagen and laminin, and biomaterials used for construction of invasive medical devices. These interactions stimulate specific receptors and glycoprotein-rich domains (integrins and nonintegrin) on the plasma membrane and lead to the activation of intracellular effector enzymes. The majority of regulatory events appear to require free calcium. Ionized calcium is the primary bioregulator, and a variety of biochemical mechanisms modulate the level and availability of free cytosolic calcium. Major enzymes that regulate the free calcium levels via second messengers include phospholipase C, phospholipase A2, and phospholipase D, together with adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases. Activation of phospholipase C results in the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate and formation of second messengers 1,2-diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Diglyceride induces activation of protein kinase C, whereas IP3 mobilizes calcium from internal membrane stores. Elevation of cytosolic calcium stimulates phospholipase A2 and liberates arachidonic acid. Free arachidonic acid is transformed to a novel metabolite, thromboxane A2, by fatty acid synthetases. Thromboxane A2 is the major metabolite of this pathway and plays a critical role in platelet recruitment, granule mobilization and secretion. Up-regulation in signalling pathways will increase the risk for clinical complications associated with thromboembolic episodes. Down-regulation of signal transduction mechanisms may precipitate bleeding diathesis or stroke.",

        "The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-629) was signed by President George Bush almost three years ago on November 28, 1990. The law expanded the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) authority to regulate medical devices and grew out of congressional concerns about the FDA's ability to quickly learn when a medical device caused an adverse patient event, and to ensure that hazardous devices are removed from hospitals and other health care facilities in a timely manner. The Safe Medical Devices Act is an extension of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, which imposed production, distribution, and sales rules on medical device manufacturers. It gives the FDA the legal authority to directly regulate the use of medical devices in health care facilities. Among the Safe Medical Devices Act's provisions are specific requirements for hospitals, health professionals, and other users of medical devices to report patient incidents involving medical devices to the manufacturer and to the FDA if a device caused or contributed to a serious injury, death, or other \"adverse experience.\" Adverse experiences are defined by the FDA to include concussions, fractures, burns, temporary paralysis, and temporary loss of sight, hearing, or smell. Hospitals have been required to comply with this provision of the law, called user reporting, since 1991. Hospitals are also required to participate in tracking certain medical devices whose failure could result in a serious adverse health outcome. The law requires distributors and manufacturers of specific devices to adopt a method for device tracking. Hospitals are required to cooperate with and provide device manufacturers with information about patients with permanently implantable devices and life-sustaining and life-supporting devices used outside device user facilities. The law also gives the FDA the authority to designate other devices subject to tracking if the agency determines such tracking is warranted to preserve the patient's health. This provision of the law is called device tracking. Device tracking became effective on August 29, 1993. This special report addresses some of the major questions about implementing user reporting and device tracking in hospitals. Over the past two years the FDA has issued a series of rules and regulations that have caused a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding. Some of the law's provisions are straightforward; however, some basic issues and rules--such as the definition of a reportable event--are unclear. While there are still some open questions about the reporting and tracking requirements, the following is the best information available at this time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",
        "Agrobacteria are associated more commonly with plant than with human disease. The isolation of Agrobacterium radiobacter from blood cultures of an immunocompromised child with a transcutaneous catheter prompted a review of human infections caused by Agrobacterium species. Only 12 reports describing 19 cases of Agrobacterium infections in humans have appeared in the literature. Sixteen of the patients (84%) were equipped with implantable or transcutaneous medical devices at the time of infection, and 14 of the 19 (80%) patients could be considered immunocompromised because of underlying disease processes. Unlike those in previous reports, however, this patient was infected with a novel mucoid phenotype of A. radiobacter. Because of the significant relationship between infection and biomedical implants, we evaluated the adhesion of this mucoid strain and a nonmucoid strain of A. radiobacter to plastic by using two in vitro assays. No adhesion or biofilm formation was detected for either strain, but nonetheless it is clear from this review that the isolation of Agrobacterium spp. from patients with indwelling medical appliances should not be dismissed as an environmental contaminant.",

        "To explore how and what Australian and American registered nurses working in critical care and high-dependency units initially learn about the life-sustaining medical devices they use as well as the consequences of device use both for patients and staff.\nCross-sectional survey with a mailed questionnaire.\nLarge midwestern American tertiary care center and two large South Australian tertiary care centers.\nThirty-two American registered nurses who worked in critical care and 127 Australian registered nurses who worked in critical care, coronary care, and high-dependency units.\nThe most frequently identified initial method of learning both for Australian and American registered nurses was trial and error (taught self). A significantly larger proportion of American nurses initially learned to use a life-sustaining device by watching a video or slide tape, whereas a significantly larger proportion of Australian nurses received instruction in nursing school. At least 90% of Australian and American nurses indicated they initially had learned the same four facts about the device: its purpose, its function, how to respond to the alarms, and how to operate it. A significantly larger proportion of Australian nurses indicated that they had learned about the potential hazards for patients than did their American colleagues. The potential consequences of using any medical device were nurse stress and patient harm. The two reasons most frequently cited by Australian and American nurses for stress were fear of harming the patient and being unsure how to use the device. Of the Australian and American nurses combined, 12.3% indicated they had used a medical device that had harmed a patient.\nAustralian and American registered nurses were more similar than dissimilar in terms of how and what they learned about the life-sustaining devices they use in direct patient care, in experiencing stress when using medical devices, and in having used a device that caused patient harm. Differences in how they learn may be a reflection of marketing and inservice support by manufacturers and basic and highest levels of nurse education. The latter may also account for differences in what Australian and American nurses learned. The results emphasize that nurses must be knowledgeable about the devices they use on behalf of patients. More knowledge about the devices they use in direct patient care might decrease nurse stress.",

        "Some factors that determine the development and diffusion of medical technologies are discussed. The use of technology in pregnancy and labor cannot be seen as a response to user needs or the result of societal planning alone. Often technologies are developed and diffused without any evaluation of their risks and benefits. The relations between medical research and industrial interests are focused on to explain the development, and against this background user interests and women's strategies as users and providers of health care are discussed.\nThe aim of this article is to provide background information on what determines the development of new medical technologies:  medical knowledge, work organization, drugs, devices, and other factors used in health care services.  The process of childbearing and all phases of reproduction have been \"invaded\" by medical procedures and technology in Western countries and in the developing world.  Basic needs of mothers and children are not being met.  The probing question is in what way can women influence further development of medical technology.  The development of health care has been based on large investments in hospitals, equipment, drugs, and medical devices and concepts of illness as the malfunctioning of organs and body parts in a very mechanistic way.  The diffusion of technology has bought with it inadequate evaluations, ignored evaluations, mistakes such as thalidomide, and waste.  Auscultation by stethoscope, as used by midwives, has been shown to be as effective as electronic fetal monitoring which is bothersome to women in labor.  Routine scanning with ultrasound has not been proved to be necessary.  This technology is justified because it is a useful tool for fetal research.  Who is asking whether health resources should be used for developing perfect babies?  There is mutual interest between doctors and industry to continue with the development of medical innovations:  profit prestige, and professional advancement. At the individual level, there may be a conflict with the societal policy or priorities; the individual health purpose of the technology may become secondary and eventually disregarded.  In the case of infertility, the development of the in vitro fertilization method was spurred on by consumer demand, without consideration at the policy level about adoption, or change in culture, or the replacement of a personal and intimate generation of life with a mechanization of human production of the species.  The health issues of women should include reproductive health and genetic engineering; health must be defined as physical, mental, and social well being, and not just the absence of disease. There are different views of health care and different interests in health care technology.  Assessments must be made of new technologies before widespread diffusion.",
        "Reservoir-type microcapsules were prepared using a double emulsion solvent evaporation process from a range of different poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate homopolymers and copolymers thereof with 3-hydroxyvalerate (P(HB-HV) polymers) blended with 20 per cent by weight of poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL). Microcapsules prepared from these P(HB-HV)/20 per cent PCL blends had very different typical surface morphologies from those prepared from the corresponding unblended P(HB-HV) polymers. At this blend ratio the effects of polymer blending on particle morphology were clearly dependent on the molecular weight of P(HB-HV) polymer and, to a reduced extent, the 3-hydroxyvalerate content. Microcapsules were also prepared from blends of a high molecular weight P(HB-HV) polymer with PCL in which the proportion of the latter was varied from 0 to 100 per cent at 10 per cent intervals. Increasing the proportion of PCL from 0 to 50 per cent produced a systematic and dramatic increase in microcapsule porosity; with only skeletal particles being generated from the even 50-50 blend. When the proportion of PCL in the blends was increased from 50 to 70 per cent the level of particle porosity diminished, and at 80 per cent or above the microcapsules were essentially smooth and non-porous.",

        "The mismatching of battery cell capacities within a rechargeable battery pack can result in reduced cycle life and operating time, as well as an increased safety risk due to gas release, which is a concern when used in implantable medical devices, such as a ventricular assist device (VAD). Two groups of four nickel/cadmium (Ni/Cd) battery packs containing 10 cells each (i.e., 12 volt packs) were evaluated for their cycle life, safe operating time, and the impact of mismatched cell capacities within the pack. Four control battery packs containing capacity matched cells (within +/- 0.4% of mean) and four battery packs each containing one low capacity cell (4.7-10.7% below mean) together with nine high capacity matched cells (within +/- 0.6% of mean) were charge/discharge cycled at 37 degrees C using a 9.7 W average pulsatile discharge load and a 30 minute discharge time on each cycle. Periodically, the battery packs were fully discharged down to 10 volts and each cell was monitored for negative voltages. The capacity matched and mismatched packs yielded similar performance curves, with an initial decline in mean total operating time until a plateau was reached of 41.1 +/- 1.5 and 41.8 +/- 1.8 minutes of discharge time, respectively. The mean total operating times of the matched and mismatched packs began to decline again after approximately 670 and 635 cycles, respectively. Cell voltage monitoring showed no negative voltages, indicating that no gases were released from the cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
        "The authors have demonstrated that an amphiphilic block co-polymer composed of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and styrene (HEMA-st) showed excellent blood compatibility in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments. The poor elastomeric properties of HEMA-st, however, have been an obstacle to its wider application in medical devices. To improve the mechanical properties of HEMA-st, the authors have developed a new amphiphilic block co-polymer composed of HEMA and octylstyrene (HEMA-oct). The size and morphology of the microdomain structures of HEMA-oct observed by transmission electron microscopy were similar to those of HEMA-st. Kink resistance tests showed improved elastomeric properties of HEMA-oct over HEMA-st. The blood compatibility of HEMA-oct was evaluated using an in vitro flow cell system combined with an epifluorescent video microscope, in which real time platelet adhesion and activation in whole blood can be observed and quantified, and ex vivo rabbit A-A shunt experiments. HEMA-st and a polyurethane (Pellethane 2363-80AE) were used for comparison. In a flow cell system, both HEMA-st and HEMA-oct showed minimal platelet coverage on the surfaces and less platelet activation as measured by beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), whereas Pellethane showed a considerable amount of platelet coverage with high beta-TG production.

        "The authors have developed methods to enhance albumin binding to modified silicone rubber (SR) films. An intermediate bifunctional coupling agent, polyvinylmethyl siloxane-comethyl-1-ethanol siloxane (PVMS-CO-MES), is prepared from a cyclic tetramer, vinyl-methyl siloxane, by an oxymercuration-demercuration reaction, and cross-linked to silicone rubber under mild peroxide catalytic conditions. Free mercury on the surface was obtained under many reaction conditions and is shown to materially enhance 125I-labeled albumin binding. The mechanism most likely occurs via disulfide bond breakage, protein denaturation, and aggregation. The possible role of iodine-mercury bonds, an artefactual source, is ruled out with the aid of total internal reflectance-fluorescence measurements of the albumin adsorption rate constant. Although in situ albumin aggregation via disulfide bond breakage is a potentially attractive method for biocompatible protein gel formation, the toxicity of mercury makes the current method unfit for clinical practice.",

        "The AMS Hydroflex* penile prosthesis was introduced for commercial distribution in 1985 but 5 years later this device was no longer available on the United States market. In an attempt to understand why this device, which initially enjoyed substantial popularity, was abruptly withdrawn from the market, patients who underwent implantation at the University of Wisconsin were interviewed and a critical analysis of the Food and Drug Administration approval process of medical devices was performed. An AMS Hydroflex penile prosthesis was implanted in 17 patients (mean age 57.7 years, range 27 to 84 years). The followup period ranged from 37 to 73 months with a mean of 58 months, and 3 patients died within that time. Of the remaining patients 10 (71%) were satisfied with the device in the first months after implantation but only 6 (43%) were satisfied at the time of followup, 9 (64%) were more satisfied with sexual relationships after receiving the prosthesis and 7 (50%) found the prosthesis simple to operate. Mechanical failure was noticed by 11 patients (79%), of whom 5 (45%) underwent further surgery. Classification of medical devices started with the enactment of the Medical Device Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, May 28, 1976. All medical devices that were in commercial distribution at that time were classified in 3 regulatory control categories depending upon the degree of regulation necessary to assure safety and effectiveness of each device. Before May 28, 1976 no approved application was necessary for marketing medical devices, and the Food and Drug Administration has variable amounts of information about safety and effectiveness of the different devices marketed prior to that date. Since May 1976 approved applications have been mandated for new or significantly changed devices. The specific process by which the Hydroflex prosthesis, as well as other medical devices, is approved is critically reviewed.",

The highest infection rates are seen in surgical, burn, trauma, and neonatal ICUs. Acquisition of infection is a major determinant of mortality in ICUs, and prolongs the length of ICU stay. Predominant pathogens include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Candida spp. They are more likely to be resistant to antimicrobial agents than are isolates from elsewhere in the hospital. Exposure to invasive medical devices is the predominant risk factor for infection, and strategies to prevent infection are aimed at reducing microbial colonization on and around devices.

By conducting this study each year, a database will be established and maintained on the various ways in which the sterilization of medical devices is achieved.  In the longer term this will indicate changes in the market for sterilization equipment and services and will identify future trends in this very important segment of the medical device industry.  Such information will be passed on to the readers of Medical Device Technology in forthcoming issues of the magazine.",
        "A number of plasma-based techniques for sterilizing heat-sensitive medical equipment at low temperatures are being developed worldwide as alternatives to existing chemical and gaseous sterilization methods.  The techniques involve the use of plasmas in controlled sterilization processes that increase operator safety and offer medical device manufacturers the option of using materials they cannot currently consider because of the incompatability of those materials with existing sterilization technologies.  In this article, the author discusses three development programmes that are under way and assesses the potential applications of the technique as an alternative to ethylene oxide sterilization.  The potential of the technique to meet in-house sterilization requirements of medical product manufacturers is also discussed.",

In this article, the authors explain how conversion can be manageably achieved by providing a step-by-step conversion programme.",
        "Unlike previous medical device laws, the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA), which became effective November 28, 1991 applies to \"device-user facilities\" such as hospitals and long-term care facilities. Final regulations are scheduled for release later this spring. The SMDA's primary goals are to: Ensure all devices currently in or entering the marketplace are safe and effective Enable the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to learn quickly about serious problems with medical devices Remove defective devices (old and new) from the market To achieve these goals, Congress has given the FDA new review and enforcement powers, including the authority to impose fines on those in violation of the law. Incidents in which a medical device caused or contributed to the death, serious illness, or serious injury of a patient are referred to as medical device-reportable (MDR) events. A user must report MDR deaths to the FDA and to the manufacturer (if known). Serious illnesses and serious injuries caused by or attributed to the use of a device must be reported to the device manufacturer or, if the manufacturer is unknown, to the FDA. Facilities must report MDR events to the FDA semiannually and maintain incident files for two years after reporting the MDR event. The FDA may assess civil penalties against parties that do not comply with the SMDA's reporting provisions. Healthcare facilities must develop and implement employee training and education programs to help physicians, nurses, and other allied health employees identify and report MDR events.",

        "Modern leukocyte removal filters have been developed after years of refinement in design. Current filters are composite filters in which synthetic microfiber material is prepared as a nonwoven web. The filter material may be surface modified to alter surface tension or charge to improve performance. The housing design promotes effective contact of blood with the filter material and decreases shear forces. The exact mechanisms by which these filters remove leukocytes from blood components are uncertain, but likely represent a combination of both physical and biological processes whose contributions to leukocyte removal are interdependent. Small-pore microfiber webs result in barrier phenomena that permit retention of individual cells and increase the total adsorptive area of the filter. Modifications in surface charge can increase or decrease cell attraction to the fibers. Optimum interfacial surface tensions between blood cells, plasma, and filter fibers not only permit effective blood flow through small fiber pores, but also facilitate cell contact with the material. Barrier retention is a common mechanism for all modern leukocyte-removal filters and applies to all leukocyte subtypes. Because barrier retention does not depend on cell viability, it is operative for cells of any age and will retain any nondeformable cell, including whole nuclei from lymphocytes or monocytes. Barrier retention is supplemented by retention by adhesion. RBCs, lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and platelets differ in their relative adhesiveness to filter fibers. Different adhesive mechanisms are used in filters designed for RBCs compared with filters designed for platelets. Although lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes can adhere directly to filter fibers, the biological mechanisms underlying cell adhesion may differ for these cell types. These differences may depend on expression of cell adhesion molecules. In the case of filtration of fresh RBCs, platelet-leukocyte interaction seems to supplement other mechanisms of leukocyte retention. The interactions of cells with biomaterials is an area of important research for implantable medical devices, artificial organs, and orthopedic, vascular, and dental prosthetics. Research in these areas is likely to contribute to improved biomaterials for blood filters. Improved techniques for the preparation of hybrid polymers and new techniques for surface modification of existing polymers will increase the technical opportunities for the development of synthetic surfaces ideally designed for leukocyte removal. It is therefore likely that the performance of leukocyte-removal filters will continue to improve. The development of cost-effective leukocyte removal filters specifically designed for use during component preparation would permit leukocyte depletion of all cellular blood components.",
        "The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation develops voluntary standards for medical devices so that manufacturers might provide information on their product and basic safety and performance criteria that should be considered in qualifying the instrument for clinical use. American national standards are generated through a consensus process by committees consisting of experts in research, development, and design from user, industry, and government communities. Draft standards are made available for public review and may become American national standards after review by the American National Standards Institute. The first American national standard for electronic and automated sphygmomanometers was published in monograph form in 1987. The objective of the revised 1992 standard for electronic and automated sphygmomanometers is to provide updated labeling, safety, and performance requirements that help ensure that consumers and health care professionals are supplied with safe, accurate devices for the indirect measurement of blood pressure, including ambulatory blood pressure recorders. This standard permits validation of the automatic or electronic device by comparison with either direct, intra-arterial blood pressure measurements or the noninvasive cuff/stethoscope technique, based on Korotkoff sounds identified by individuals trained in auscultation. This summary report of the 1992 American national standard for automatic sphygmomanometers provides recommendations for the methods of comparison, statistical analysis of the data, presentation of the results, and criteria for acceptability. Users, researchers, and instrument designers should refer to the American national standard monograph for detailed requirements.",

        "The software engineering and quality assurance disciplines are a requisite to the design of safe and effective software-based medical devices. It is in the areas of software methodology and process that the most beneficial application of these disciplines to software development can be made. Software is a product of complex operations and methodologies and is not amenable to the traditional electromechanical quality assurance processes. Software quality must be built in by the developers, with the software verification and validation engineers acting as the independent instruments for ensuring compliance with performance objectives and with development and maintenance standards. The implementation of a software quality assurance program is a complex process involving management support, organizational changes, and new skill sets, but the benefits are profound. Its rewards provide safe, reliable, cost-effective, maintainable, and manageable software, which may significantly speed the regulatory review process and therefore potentially shorten the overall time to market. The use of a trial project can greatly facilitate the learning process associated with the first-time application of a software quality assurance program.",
        "Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from nine patients (16.2 isolations/1,000 patient-days) in a surgical intensive care unit during an outbreak in November 1990; this rate of isolation was three times higher than that noted previously on this unit. Three patients were infected with the same strain, as defined by identical serotypes, pyocin types, and contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) electrophoresis patterns of digested genomic DNA. The hands of 80 health care workers were cultured, and a strain of P. aeruginosa identical to that infecting the three patients was isolated from the hands of a nurse providing care to all three. Environmental surfaces, medical devices, and ward stock supplies were cultured; none of these cultures yielded this strain. No clusters of infection with this strain or other strains of P. aeruginosa were observed after compliance with hand-washing and universal precautions was reemphasized. Thus this outbreak was linked to the carriage of P. aeruginosa on the hands of a health care worker. It could not be determined definitively whether this carriage was the source of the cluster or a consequence of it. However, the geographic and temporal clustering of carriage with an outbreak due to a strain of an apparently identical molecular type underlines the importance of routine hand washing between contacts with different patients.",
        "This case report describes the use of a new medical device that utilizes vacuum-compression therapy (VCT) in the management of a 30-year-old female patient with severe arteriosclerosis and an associated nonhealing fasciotomy wound. Attempts were made to treat the patient with local care consisting of debridement and saline-moistened gauze dressings. Following a poor response to nonsurgical management, a skin graft was performed in an attempt to encourage more rapid healing. Infection and poor healing followed the graph, and only 40% of the graft remained viable after 12 days. Outpatient physical therapy management consisted of hydrotherapy and hydrocolloid dressings. This treatment resulted in minimal success until combined with VCT. The patient received hydrotherapy, VCT, and hydrocolloid dressings three times per week for 11 weeks. Wound healing occurred at an average rate of 0.64 cm2 per day, and the wound completely reepithelialized by the end of the eighth week of VCT therapy. Increased capillary filling is proposed as a primary factor in the improved healing.",

        "When used in an air medical setting, medical equipment designed for use in hospitals can fail from the stresses of in-flight use, or they interfere with critical rotor-wing aircraft systems. From January 1989 to June 1992, 34 medical devices, including monitor/defibrillators, infusion pumps, vital-signs monitors, ventilators and infant transport incubators, were tested under extreme conditions of temperature, humidity, altitude and vibration (MIL-STD 810D). Electromagnetic emissions and susceptibility were measured (MIL-STD 461C and 462), and human factors were evaluated. The devices were flight tested in a UH-60 MEDEVAC helicopter. Thirty-two percent of the medical devices failed at least one environmental test, and 91% of the devices failed to meet electromagnetic interference standards. Failures included excess conducted and radiated emissions and susceptibility to radiated emissions. Five (15%) of the devices were judged unsuitable for use in the UH-60 MEDEVAC helicopter. Testing is critical to discover the ability of a medical device to perform in the harsh rotor-wing MEDEVAC environment. Failure of a device or interference with aircraft systems can result in loss of a patient or aircrew.",

        "To examine the trends of intravenous vancomycin usage during a 10-year period, to classify the indications for which physicians prescribed the antibiotic, and to identify the independent predictors for empirical use of vancomycin.\nA descriptive epidemiological study, a cross-sectional study, and a case-control study were performed.\nA 900-bed university-teaching hospital.\nThe annual crude usage (grams) and incidence density (grams/1000 patient-days) of vancomycin were measured for 10 years (July 1981 to July 1991). In 109 randomly selected patient medical records, we evaluated the proportion of usage of vancomycin classified as prophylaxis, empirical therapy, or specifically directed therapy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify determinants of empirical administration of vancomycin vs a penicillase-resistant penicillin to 64 case patients and 64 control patients.\nThe rate of vancomycin usage increased 20-fold from 5.72 g/1000 patient-days in 1981 to 121.25 g/1000 patient-days in 1991. The use of vancomycin was significantly higher (P < .0001) in hematology-oncology areas compared with that in other hospital areas. The rates for each indication for vancomycin were 35.0% for prophylaxis 31.8% for empirical therapy, and 33.2% for therapy specifically directed by culture results. In a multivariate analysis, the presence of \"plastic\" medical devices was the best independent predictor for patients receiving vancomycin: intravenous lines (odds ratio [OR], 6.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.28 to 17.06; P < .001), Hickman catheters (OR, 76.12; 95% CI, 15.06 to 384.73; P < .001), and other medical devices (OR, 10.50; 95% CI, 2.54 to 43.38; P = .001).\nVancomycin use has increased linearly in the last decade primarily related to the presence of indwelling vascular devices in hematology-oncology patients. Use of vancomycin is equally divided among empirical therapy, prophylaxis, and specific therapy for a documented infection.",
        "Synopsis An established cytotoxicity test for plastic materials in medical devices has been adapted and used to assess the relative potential irritancy of cosmetic ingredients and formulations during product development. Serum-free medium containing a novel protein supplement supported growth in suspension of LS mouse fibroblast cells. Release of the vital dye Neutral Red from pre-loaded cells suspended in agar was the endpoint. Test substances and reference standards were applied to a central well cut into the agar, a sensitive method which allowed accurate dose application and yielded consistent results. Relative irritancy potential was measured quantitatively by comparing the diameters of the clear zones of damaged cells which surround the central well. The test has been used with raw materials such as surfactants, preservatives and herbal extracts, as well as finished products ranging from shampoos and conditioners to creams, lotions and coloured cosmetics. The method is practical, versatile, reproducible and economic to use.

        "To describe the distribution of nosocomial infections among surgical patients by site of infection for different types of operations, and to show how the risk of certain adverse outcomes associated with nosocomial infection varied by site, type of operation, and exposure to specific medical devices.\nSurveillance of surgical patients during January 1986-June 1992 using standard definitions and protocols for both comprehensive (all sites, all operations) and targeted (all sites, selected operations) infection detection.\nAcute care US hospitals participating in the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) System: 42,509 patients with 52,388 infections from 95 hospitals using comprehensive surveillance protocols and an additional 5,659 patients with 6,963 infections from 11 more hospitals using a targeted protocol.\nSurgical site infection was the most common nosocomial infection site (37%) when data were reported by hospitals using the comprehensive protocols. When infections reported from both types of protocols were stratified by type of operation, other sites were most frequent following certain operations (e.g., urinary tract infection after joint prosthesis surgery [52%]). Among the infected surgical patients who died, the probability that an infection was related to the patient's death varied significantly with the site of infection, from 22% for urinary tract infection to 89% for organ/space surgical site infection, but was independent of the type of operation performed. The probability of developing a secondary bloodstream infection also varied significantly with the primary site of infection, from 3.1% for incisional surgical site infection to 9.5% for organ/space surgical site infection (p < .001). For all infections except pneumonia, the risk of developing a secondary bloodstream infection also varied significantly with the type of operation performed (p < .001) and was generally highest for cardiac surgery and lowest for abdominal hysterectomy. Surgical patients who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia were more than twice as likely to develop a secondary bloodstream infection as nonventilated pneumonia patients (8.1% versus 3.3%, p < .001).\nFor surgical patients with nosocomial infection, the distribution of nosocomial infections by site varies by type of operation, the frequency with which nosocomial infections contribute to patient mortality varies by site of infection but not by type of operation, and the risk of developing a secondary bloodstream infection varies by type of primary infection and, except for pneumonia, by type of operation.",
        "Since 1984, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has utilized the Medical Device Reporting system as a mechanism for reporting adverse incidents associated with the use of medical devices, including external defibrillators. The frequency and content of these reports prompted an FDA-conducted five-state study of defibrillator-user training and maintenance practices for both devices and batteries. The study also included inspection and testing of defibrillators and batteries to assess their state of maintenance. A detailed review of the reports and of the five-state data confirmed that in the majority of cases, adverse incidents were related to improper defibrillator operation and maintenance, prompting the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health to launch an educational effort directed toward those who operate and maintain defibrillators. Proper maintenance of batteries (both nickel-cadmium and sealed lead-acid) was a major component of the educational thrust, because battery failure was identified as a recurrent and preventable problem. In an effort to correct the diverse types of incidents being reported, checklists were developed by the FDA for both manual and automated defibrillators. The checklists are designed to cover the spectrum of reported problems related to both device and user. The advent of more stringent FDA adverse incident-reporting regulations, coupled with increased use of defibrillators in diverse settings with varying usage frequencies, would seem to give a major impetus to the regular use of these checklists wherever defibrillators are employed.",

        "Data from the 1988 Medical Device Implant Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey are used to summarize information about the prevalence of artificial hips among adults in the United States. The 1988 National Health Interview Survey was a cross-sectional survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized United States population, and included 122,310 persons in 47,485 households in a multistage probability sample. The supplement supplied the first population-based estimates of prevalence and morbidity of selected medical devices. Projected to the United States population, the survey results indicate that an estimated 674,000 adults were using 811,000 hip implants. Hip implant recipients were significantly more likely to be older, to be white, and to have lower educational, income, and activity levels than the general population of adults. After age-stratification, however, only differences in activity limitation and race remained. Current economic outlays for hip replacement surgery are substantial. With the aging population, use of health services by patients with artificial hips will probably increase unless measures to reduce the need for replacement surgery are instituted. These measures include reducing injuries and improving biomaterials. Further investigation is needed to examine the activity limitation and racial difference in prevalence found in this study.",

        "Concern is increasing regarding the risk of transmission of blood-borne pathogens by means of improperly reprocessed medical devices.\nOn-site surveys of policies and practices were performed in 18 reprocessing areas in eight randomly selected hospitals in Massachusetts to assess current practices for reprocessing of flexible fiberoptic endoscopes. Manufacturers' and internal written protocols, were reviewed, employees were interviewed, and procedures were observed. Reprocessing included high-level disinfection in 17 of 18 areas, with 16 areas using 2% glutaraldehyde; ethylene oxide gas sterilization was used in one area.\nConsiderable interhospital and intrahospital variability was found in high-level disinfection procedures, including equipment, contact time (range 10 to 45 minutes), disinfectant testing, and rinsing. Disinfection of internal channels was inadequate in three areas, recommended sterilization of biopsy forceps was not performed in five, and written protocols were unavailable in three. Ad hoc deviation from established written or verbal protocols occurred in eight areas during reprocessing of flexible fiberoptic endoscopes from patients known to have AIDS; ethylene oxide sterilization was used in seven areas and a separate device was used in one. Interviews with personnel revealed that lack of knowledge of high-level disinfection contributed to the discrepancies between policy and practice.\nWe conclude that reprocessing of flexible fiberoptic endoscopes is inconsistent and potentially ineffective. Knowledge that a flexible fiberoptic endoscope was used for a patient with AIDS influences practice.",
        "As the issue of data overload is a problem in critical care today, it is of utmost importance to improve acquisition, storage, integration, and presentation of medical data, which appears only feasible with the help of bedside computers. The data originates from four major sources: (1) the bedside medical devices, (2) the local area network (LAN) of the ICU, (3) the hospital information system (HIS) and (4) manual input. All sources differ markedly in quality and quantity of data and in the demands of the interfaces between source of data and patient database. The demands for data acquisition from bedside medical devices, ICU-LAN and HIS concentrate on technical problems, such as computational power, storage capacity, real-time processing, interfacing with different devices and networks and the unmistakable assignment of data to the individual patient. The main problem of manual data acquisition is the definition and configuration of the user interface that must allow the inexperienced user to interact with the computer intuitively. Emphasis must be put on the construction of a pleasant, logical and easy-to-handle graphical user interface (GUI). Short response times will require high graphical processing capacity. Moreover, high computational resources are necessary in the future for additional interfacing devices such as speech recognition and 3D-GUI. Therefore, in an ICU environment the demands for computational power are enormous. These problems are complicated by the urgent need for friendly and easy-to-handle user interfaces. Both facts place ICU bedside computing at the vanguard of present and future workstation development leaving no room for solutions based on traditional concepts of personal computers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Aircraft systems and medical devices generate electromagnetic fields. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) can cause faulty operation of aircraft systems or medical devices and endanger patients or aircraft crewmembers. A ground and inflight study was conducted to describe the electromagnetic fields in typical operations. Broadband isotropic field sensors measured electric fields from 5 kHz to 3 MHz, 3 to 500 MHz, and 0.5 MHz to 6 GHz. Fields were measured at 0.5 m space intervals in JOH-58A, JUH-1H, and JUH-60A helicopters with systems off, operating RPM, 5-ft hover, 50-ft hover, and cruise. Electric fields in the environment were homogeneous and less than 0.1 V/m. Fields in the helicopters increased during ascent, but remained less than 2 V/m except during radio transmissions. EMI effect of the Physio Control Lifepack 8 was demonstrated during FM radio transmission. The results are useful in evaluating electromagnetic emissions and predicting operations that may result in an inflight malfunction of a medical device or aircraft system.",

A dose-related decrease in slime production was observed with increasing concentrations of salicylic acid. S. epidermidis grown in 5 mM salicylic acid were less likely to adhere to Silastic, polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, and Teflon catheters (P less than .006); strains grown in 2 mM salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, or phenylbutazone were less adherent to Silastic catheters (P less than .001). Similar results were obtained with polyurethane catheters. S. epidermidis strains were less likely to adhere (43%-82% inhibition) to polyurethane catheters treated with 500 mM salicylic acid diluted in ethanol (P less than .0001). Similar differences were not observed with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or acetylsalicylic acid. Adherence of radiolabeled S. epidermidis to salicylic acid-treated Silastic catheters demonstrated a dose-related reduction. The use of salicylic acid to coat medical devices may decrease the incidence of device-related infection.",
        "Many anesthesiologists have come to depend on automatic noninvasive blood pressure monitoring to obtain blood pressure (BP) readings. A case is presented in which, during a critical phase of the anesthetic, an automatic noninvasive blood pressure (ANIBP) device not only failed to provide meaningful clinical data but, in fact, gave an error message that was misleading. At the time of the message, the patient was noted to be in ventricular trigeminy at a rate of 92 beats/min. It appears that the repetitive beat-to-beat fall in blood pressure due to the dysrhythmia \"fooled\" the automatic noninvasive blood pressure device's software algorithm into believing that there was an air leak in the system. Thus, in addition to pointing out an unappreciated and potentially troubling device-related critical event, the present case demonstrates the importance of good human factors design for medical devices used in the critical care setting. In particular, the issue is raised of how medical devices should deal with uncertain or potentially misleading data.",

The foundation for wound care recent advances has been built upon the developments achieved in polymer technology over the last three decades. New and unique materials have been engineered to provide properties with significant technical and clinical benefits. These new wound care products were made possible by the convergence of three interrelated disciplines: (1) more complete understanding of the underlying principles of dermal wound healing processes, (2) new elastomeric polymers capable of being fabricated into protective dressings, and (3) advances in breathable adhesive technology. The following discussion provides a critical review of the current status of technology and the worldwide opportunities for improved wound management products. Particular attention is focused on the clinical applications of the newer, breathable dressing products, which approximate a temporary synthetic artificial skin.",

In the following article, the author discusses some implications of the new law.",
        "Staphylococcus epidermidis is an important nosocomial pathogen responsible for intravenous catheter-related bacteremia and infections of other prosthetic medical devices. We found that the ability of S. epidermidis to hemagglutinate erythrocytes correlated with the adherence of bacteria to plastic and to intravenous catheters. S. epidermidis isolates responsible for prosthetic-valve endocarditis (n = 61) and isolates from intravenous catheters (n = 59) were significantly more likely to cause hemagglutination than isolates from the skin of preoperative cardiac surgery patients (n = 19) (P = 0.027). S. epidermidis isolates (n = 23) recovered from the skin of patients 7 to 10 days after cardiac surgery were significantly more likely to exhibit hemagglutination than the preoperative isolates (P = 0.015). By a quantitative adherence assay, we also observed that the hemagglutination titer and number of species of erythrocytes agglutinated correlated directly with adherence to polystyrene (P less than 0.001). In addition, hemagglutinating isolates were significantly more likely to be recovered in high number from intravenous catheters when semiquantitative catheter culture techniques were used (P less than 0.001). We speculate that hemagglutinin(s) either plays a direct role in adherence to polymers and thus prosthetic-device infection or serves as an easily demonstrable marker for adherence-prone isolates.",

There was no significant difference in the lengths of the samples obtained with the four devices. The Monopty device yielded a significantly greater mean weight of both kidney (30.8%) and liver (31.6%) samples compared with the other devices. There were no significant differences between the four devices relative to cellular and histologic preservation, crush artifact, and number of renal glomeruli or liver lobules and portal triads. Renal subcapsular hematomas were identified in most instances, and there was no difference between the devices in the amount of renal trauma resulting from their use. There was only one instance of severe injury to the liver. The choice of instrument should remain one of personal preference, since all four devices were satisfactory and none produced significantly greater renal or hepatic injury.",
        "Choosing an effective plan for supporting a medical device is critical to its safe use, cost-effectiveness, and longevity. Hospitals can choose from a variety of support providers, including manufacturers, third-party service vendors, or hospital clinical engineering (CE) departments. However, if the hospital plans to use a third-party service vendor or its own CE department to provide support, the manufacturer's cooperation or assistance will still be needed to implement the support plan effectively. Over the years, ECRI has received many comments from hospitals about the way in which manufacturers respond to their equipment support needs. We have learned that some manufacturers are not willing to assist third-party service vendors or in-house service programs or do not always deliver the support they promise. Also, hospitals do not always consider their support needs before purchase, when they have the most leverage to negotiate flexible support arrangements. To help foster better equipment support and customer satisfaction, we polled manufacturers that have participated in recent Health Devices Evaluations to obtain detailed information about their policies toward manufacturers' contract, third-party, and in-house support. Ready access to this information will help hospitals evaluate whether manufacturers' support policies will meet their needs, and it will allow them to minimize problems by working with the manufacturer to negotiate optimal support arrangements during the purchase process. In this article, we briefly discuss the factors to consider when evaluating support alternatives and manufacturers' support policies. We also present the questions posed to each manufacturer on our Manufacturers' Support Policies Questionnaire, along with a summary of the responses that we received for each question.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Under the conditions of our test, glutaraldehyde was the most efficient agent among all substances currently recommended for disinfecting and sterilizing medical devices. Either copper or iron ions by themselves were able to inactivate virus with an efficiency similar to that of substances currently used for disinfection and sterilization. The microbicidal effect of metals, however, was enhanced further by the addition of peroxide. The mixtures of copper and peroxide described here were more efficient than glutaraldehyde in inactivating viruses and bacteria. The addition of a metal chelator to metal-peroxide mixtures further increased the microbicidal potency of the reagent. The formulations described in this study should be harmless to people but able to quickly and efficiently inactivate microorganisms, particularly viruses.",

Some 130 categories of high-risk devices are in use with little or no proof of safety, reliability or effectiveness. All appeared before 1976, the year that the Food and Drug Administration got the authority to regulate such products. Under activist chief David Kessler and with added clout from a 1990 law, the FDA plans to scrutinize the entire 130-item list. Five will get special attention starting early next year: saline-filled breast implants, inflatable penile implants, testicular implants, heart-bypass pumps and cranial stimulators.

        "The BMET or CE Supervisor is a technical manager who is close to the actual work of a biomedical or clinical engineering department. The MPTI is a management training tool that has identified differences between the effective and less-effective technical managers. These behaviors or styles can be considered and applied to the clinical engineering and BMET work environments. Effective BMET or CE Supervisors have a management identity. They are both people-oriented and task-oriented. They are good problem-solvers, and will plan and structure the work tasks and environment. When the situation requires a change in plans, however, they can adapt to the new situation easily. If a decision needs to be made that affects the organization, they will check with higher management or peer managers. Less-effective BMET or CE Supervisors will make important decisions alone, without checking with others. They plan and structure tasks and the work environment, but they are less willing to change when faced with a new situation. They are not people-oriented, and their ability to assess social situations is low. Their need for achievement recognition is often too high. The work environment has an effect on how the competence of a manager is perceived. A \"one-desk manager\" in a small, one-person biomedical engineering department has more autonomy than a CE Supervisor in a large department. Working for a medical device manufacturing firm often requires a greater management identity. An engineering consultant is often a managing specialist, rather than a traditional manager.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Quantitation of HIV in 115 seropositive individuals was undertaken to evaluate the potential for HIV transmission as a nosocomial infection through the use of medical devices that may come in contact with the peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals. The virus burden in the peripheral blood was estimated from the level of: plasma HIV p24 antigenemia; plasma viremia; p24 antigen in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lysates as indicators of productive infection; and frequency of latently infected cells. Negligible HIV levels were observed in the plasma and PBMC lysates of the majority of samples except for late-stage patients with certain opportunistic infections and/or lack of zidovudine (AZT) therapy. Some individuals on AZT therapy and at late-stage of disease may show antigenemia without plasma viremia or alternatively, plasma viremia may be observed without plasma antigenemia. PBMC lysate data indicated that the frequency of productively infected cells was less than one in 20,000 PBMCs for the majority of samples irrespective of status on AZT therapy or disease stage. HIV was detected in greater than 95% of the cocultures and within 14 days for most of the samples, again regardless of the stage of disease or status on AZT therapy. The frequency of latently infected cells in this cohort ranged from 125 to 3125 per million PBMCs and was calculated to be as high as 2.5% of the helpter T-cell (CD4+ cell) population in the peripheral blood. The average latently infected cell frequency was 2-3-fold higher in early stage patients not on AZT than in late-stage patients on AZT therapy.",
        "Bacteria that grow in association with medical devices always form slime enclosed biofilms, within which they are protected, to a large extent, from the bactericidal activity of chemical biocides and antibiotics. Mature biofilms (> 7 days) are demonstrably resistant to 500-5,000 times the concentrations of these agents than are necessary to kill free floating (planktonic) cells of the same organism. The authors have discovered that this well established inherent resistance of biofilm bacteria to antibacterial agents can be completely obviated if these agents are applied to these adherent populations within an electric field. The killing of biofilm bacteria by antibiotics can be dramatically enhanced by relatively weak electric fields (1.5 V/cm and 15 microA/cm2) that, in themselves, have no deleterious effects on these slime protected populations adherent to plastic or metal surfaces. This bioelectric technology can readily be used to enhance the preimplantation sterilization of medical devices by biocides. The authors suggest that it may also be used to control biofilm formation and consequent infection by electrically enhanced perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis and by electrically enhanced penetration of antibiotics to kill the biofilm bacteria that form the inherently resistant nidus of chronic device related infections.",

        "A procedure for determining health-based residue limits for impurities in drug substances and medical devices is described. The procedure is based upon the concept of setting residue limits that correspond to the intended usage of the drug or device, i.e., short-term use, prolonged use, and/or lifetime use. Data pertaining to chemical and physical properties, occurrence and use, biodisposition, pharmacology, toxicology, and effects in people are used. After evaluation of these data, acceptable daily intake (ADI) values are derived using a safety margin approach for short-term and prolonged exposure limits. The safety margin approach combines the use of safety factors and professional judgment. ADI values for lifetime exposure are calculated using the safety margin approach for noncarcinogens and for some carcinogens, and they are calculated using risk assessment procedures that provide ADI values corresponding to no more than a 1 in 10,000 excess lifetime cancer risk based upon maximum likelihood risk levels for other carcinogens. A weight-of-evidence test determines the use of each approach. Finally, ADI values from relevant routes and endpoints are compared and a residue limit or residue limits are estimated. The standard is expressed in terms of maximum dose per exposure period and/or dose per day and is applicable to medical products intended for short-term use, for prolonged use, and/or for lifetime use as a major clinical indications dictate.",

        "Silicone was originally regarded as inert in the human body. Silicone medical devices have been associated with various complications that may involve an immune reaction to silicone or a silicone organic complex. There have been more than 80 cases reported in the medical literature of a varied systemic autoimmune illness in patients who have had various foreign materials placed in the breast. Controversy exists as to which complications have a cause and effect relationship, and which represent coincidental findings. It is difficult to distinguish between nonspecific local reactions and reactions that have an immunological basis. Approximately 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 women in the United States have had silicone breast implants inserted for reconstruction or augmentation mammaplasty; 28 of those patients have been reported to have developed a systemic autoimmune disease. Data on the 28 reported cases do not in any way prove a causal relationship between breast implants and immune disease. Given the natural incidence of autoimmune diseases, we would expect a coincidental occurrence in the United States of more than 1,000 cases of autoimmune disease in women who had undergone breast implant surgery. Additional information must be obtained to resolve the question. The true incidence of autoimmune disease in patients with implants needs to be determined. A prospective registry of implant patients should be established and comprehensive retrospective information obtained on the implant patient population. Further experimental work is necessary on the bioreactivity of silicone.

Biofilms have been demonstrated on right heart flow-directed catheters, endocardial pacemaker leads, urinary catheters, and other medical devices. In this study, we examined arterial and central venous catheters that had been in place in ICU patients between 1 and 14 days for the presence of bacterial biofilms by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and a special scraping/sonication bacterial recovery technique. The data taken from these processes were compared with skin entry site swabs and blood cultures and correlated with patient data on infection, bacterial colonization, and antibiotic use.\nExtensive biofilm formation was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy on all 42 arterial and 26 central venous catheters. Bacteria were seen within the biofilms on 69% (29/42) of the arterial and 88% (23/26) of the central venous catheters. These two direct methods for the detection of biofilm bacteria on the catheter surfaces demonstrated the presence of adherent organisms on 81% of devices examined. Some catheters that had been in place for only 1 day were colonized by bacterial biofilms. Biofilm scraped from catheter surfaces and dispersed by mixing and sonication yielded cultures (32% of catheters) of predominantly skin bacteria. In a few instances, the recovery of bacteria from biofilms on vascular catheters coincided with positive cultures from skin entry site swabs and/or from the blood of the patient, but there was no significant correlation between bacterial recovery from the catheter surface, entry site, and/or patients' blood.\nDirect microscopic examination of 68 vascular catheters that had been in place 1 to 14 days showed that most (81%) were colonized by bacteria growing in slime-enclosed biofilms. In many cases, this colonization of catheter surfaces could be confirmed by special biofilm culture recovery methods. Although the clinical importance of bacterial biofilms on catheter surfaces is speculative, their presence and potential to serve as a nidus for infection and bacteremia in critically ill immunocompromised hosts are cause for concern.",

        "An experimental animal model was used to assess the slime layer of Staphylococcus epidermidis as a pathogenic factor in tunnel tract infections. Mice were inoculated with high-slime-producing or non-slime-producing strains of S. epidermidis, either along the length of a subcutaneous catheter or in the area where a catheter had been placed and immediately removed (controls). Among the catheter-bearing mice, the phenotypically distinct staphylococci produced similar, high frequencies of abscess formation (72% [44 of 61] versus 81% [31 of 38]; P = 0.29). In controls, the non-slime-producing organisms were significantly more pathogenic (87% [40 of 46] versus 57% [25 of 44] abscess formation; P = 0.001). No consistent difference was detected between blood isolates obtained from patients with central venous catheter bacteremia and those from neonates with bacteremia in the absence of a prosthetic medical device. Quantitative culture of removed catheters showed greater adherence by the slime-producing isolates (P = 0.014). In this mouse model, slime production by S. epidermidis did not increase the risk of catheter tunnel tract infection, despite the greater catheter adherence of the slime-producing organisms. These findings suggest that traumatized tissue may be a sufficient condition for the development of S. epidermidis catheter-associated infections.",

The sterilant contains 1-4% diglycidyl ether and 10-20% ethanol as an aqueous solution. Sterilization is achieved after exposure of the graft to the sterilant solution for a period of 7 days at an elevated temperature (30 degrees - 40 degrees C). The biologic indicator selected for efficacy studies was Bacillus subtilis niger ATCC 9372 (endospores). The grafts were inoculated with a concentrated endospore suspension and immersed in the sterilant solution for increasing time periods. After extensive rinsing over membrane filters to remove any residual sterilant, the grafts and filters were cultured in tryptic soy broth. D10 values were calculated using a fraction-negative, most probable number technique. Additionally, many representative bacteria and fungi were tested and found to be susceptible to the new sterilant developed. The diglycidyl ether/alcohol sterilant developed was found to be efficacious for sterilization of the tissue based vascular grafts tested.",

        "During the last 40 years PVC has become the most widely studied and understood polymeric biomaterial.  The success of PVC compounds is due to their ability to fulfill the complex needs of the medical device industry.  The range of properties they possess, which includes flexibility and low toxicity, is achieved by their various formulations. Plasticizers are used to meet many of the requirements and because of their ability to be extracted into biofluids they present the greatest toxicological risk.  In his discussion, the author looks at the ingredients of compound formulations and the influence of plasticizers on the toxicity.  A detailed report is provided of studies carried out in connection with di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), the most extensively used plasticizer, and the author questions the validity of using the results of animal tests for the assessment of risk to humans.  A description of the commercial production of PVC polymers and a review of the various pharmocopoeia and national standards and requirements are also included.",

        "Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to natural rubber pose a significant risk to patients with spina bifida and urogenital abnormalities, health care workers, and rubber industry workers. Other patients, outside of these high risk groups, have experienced severe allergic reactions to natural rubber as well. Awareness of this life-threatening condition by health care providers is essential if reactions are to be prevented. History alone is inadequate to identify all patients at risk, and reliable testing materials are not yet approved or widely available. Nonrubber medical devices are readily available for most uses; however, the only rubber-free condoms currently on the market do not prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted disease. The identification and detection of rubber antigens, along with mandated labeling for rubber antigen content, will contribute to the care of this growing population of patients. Efforts by the rubber industry to decrease the antigen content of natural rubber products will decrease the risk of reaction among sensitized patients and will, very likely, decrease the rate of sensitization in the future.",
        "Private-sector funding of biomedical research within academia may come from industry, foundations, the dermatologists themselves, and the public at large. Industry-funding is of benefit to both academia and industry. Industry may fund clinical and basic research and product testing. Industry is more willing to fund product testing and clinical research than basic research. Funds for dermatologic research may be obtained from manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, soaps, and detergents. Questions of academic freedom arise when research is funded by industry. The results of academic research are in the public domain; the results of intramural industry research are often proprietary, i.e., \"trade secrets.\" When there is industry funding within academia, any restraints on publication should be held to a minimum and be temporary. Publication should occur in a timely fashion, although recognizing the need for delayed publication if the results concern patentable material. When there is a consultantship, pre-arranged terms of agreement may restrict communication. Patents usually are held by the investigator's institution. The funding company may be granted world-wide, royalty-bearing licenses. Conflicts of interest may arise during any research endeavor; this warrants close attention when the research is industry funded. Stock ownership, speaker fees, blind contracts, etc., should be avoided. In any communication, funding agreements should be stated. Indirect costs are a \"necessary evil.\" There are non-research expenditures associated with all research projects for which the institution is justified in requesting compensation. Indirect costs must have definite connections to a project. As industrial funding of research within academia increases, various facets of the academia-industry relationship are receiving increasing attention. Several aspects of conflicts of interest and indirect costs must yet be resolved. When faced openly and directly, all of these issues are manageable and need not reduce the benefits to both industry and academia that are inherent in this relationship. Federal funding of academic research uses tax dollars; industry funding comes from private capital. Academia will benefit from the funding of academic biomedical research by industry. The ultimate beneficiary of the funding of academic research by industry, however, will be society at large as the medical advances derived from sound biomedical research and carefully controlled clinical trials aid patients. A solidly established academia-industry relationship is essential to the effective funding by industry of biomedical research within academia.",

        "The chest roentgenogram (chest x-ray) is an essential tool in the perioperative evaluation of high-risk surgical patients. It can provide information on chest pathologies that will influence the anesthetic or surgical plan. An understanding of chest radiography requires several steps. Knowledge of physics, or how the radiological images are produced, is essential. Basic components include radiographic density, geometric magnification, and radiographic technique. An awareness of physics will also permit correct identification and interpretation of chest anatomy and existing pathology. The clinician should use a systematic approach to interpretation. This consists of evaluating the overall quality of the film, followed by an examination of the anatomy, working from the periphery and moving toward the center to note any chest, pulmonary, or heart abnormalities. The air bronchogram and silhouette sign are indications of pathology and can assist the clinician in locating and identifying infiltrates or lesions. Once an abnormality or area of interest is identified, he or she can focus on a clinical interpretation of the pathology. Emphasis is placed on the identification of pulmonary infiltrates and the location of invasive medical devices commonly found in the perioperative patient.",

        "For years, the notion that researchers should share data freely with fellow scientists has been discussed widely. Some argue that this is especially true when the data are generated in federally funded projects. A recent provision in the reauthorization bill for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) would ensconce this principle in law. NIH grantees would be required, on demand, to furnish their data to other researchers. According to the proposed legislation, research data would have to be preserved and made avilable for 3 years after the completion of a project, and for 5 years following publication of the results in a scientific journal. One objective, according to a congressional aide, would be to make it easier for scientists with dissenting views to obtain and reanalyze data collected with public funds. It would also facilitate publication of alternative analyses. Personal records and patent applications would be exempted, but other data from clinical, behavioral, or epidemiological research focused on the evaluation or efficacy of a drug, medical device, or treatment of any sort would be covered immediately. Is such mandatory sharing of data ethical and appropriate scholarship? Does it raise potential for abuse?

The Clinical Engineering Department maintains a historical data file for medical equipment, which includes service costs information. New purchasing forms and terms have been developed for use in purchasing equipment and service. Maintenance of accurate historical data for medical devices begins at purchase, and continues to installation and through ongoing service. This requires the cooperation of the manufacturer, the service vendor, and the clinical department using the device.

Decision-making validity does not appear to be compromised with such a technique. When tested on a sample of 146 medical devices in five different categories, the model recommended that two devices be replaced within the existing fiscal year and eight in the following year, and that fifteen devices be placed in an advisory category. The model's recommendations appear to be compatible with existing subjective criteria.",
        "Reservoir-type microcapsules were prepared using a double emulsion solvent evaporation technique from a series of nine different poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)-based polymers in which both molecular weight and hydroxyvalerate content were varied. Particles prepared from a low molecular weight (MW 43,000) homopolymer had a shrivelled appearance, but were not porous. When the molecular weight of the fabricating homopolymer was increased to 540,000, however, these features disappeared and non-wrinkled particles with microporous surfaces were observed. Microcapsules prepared from a high molecular weight copolymer of PHB with 10.8 per cent hydroxyvalerate (HV) had a similar appearance, but particles prepared from a high molecular weight 20.1 per cent HV copolymer had much smoother and less porous surfaces. Lowering the molecular weight of the copolymer had the effect of producing particles that were generally distorted in shape and had highly irregular, macroporous, surface morphologies. Increasing the double emulsion temperature to 40 degrees C at 2 min after phase combination typically generated smoother and/or less porous particles and improved the batch yield. The numerous factors potentially responsible for the development of morphological characteristics of the products are discussed in the light of these observations.",
        "The physical and degradative properties of polyhydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate copolymer blends with polycaprolactone were investigated. Blends containing low levels of polycaprolactone (less than 20%) were found to possess a considerable degree of compatibility, whilst those with higher levels of polycaprolactone were incompatible and showed phase separation behaviour. This incompatibility was most marked in blends containing approximately 50% of each component. In blends containing low levels of polycaprolactone, processing conditions governed the ease of crystallization of polycaprolactone in the polyhydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate matrix and thus the mechanical property of the blend. The degradation rate of these blends was found to be influenced by a complex set of factors, including temperature, pH and polycaprolactone content of the blend. Although crystallinity affected the mechanical properties of the blends, its influence on the hydrolytic degradation rate was masked by the large difference in the molecular weight of the polyhydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate copolymers (MW approximately 300,000) and polycaprolactone. (MW approximately 50,000). The polyhydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate/polycaprolactone blends were found to be much more stable to hydrolytic degradation than polyhydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate/polysaccharide blends previously studied. Here the combined techniques of goniophotometry and surface energy measurements proved extremely valuable in monitoring the early stages of degradation, during which surface, rather than bulk degradation, processes predominate.",

        "Particles of known size ranges of carbon fibre-reinforced carbon were presented to in vitro cultures of murine macrophages. Particles of up to 20 microns diameter were phagocytosed. Larger particles were not phagocytosed but became surrounded by aggregations of macrophages, some of which migrated on to the particle surfaces. Mean rates of phagocytosis up to 2.5 particles per hour were observed. Cells presented with a large excess of particles became rounded, detached from the substrate and some underwent lysis. The implications of these findings for the fate of particulates released from implanted medical devices is discussed. It is argued that a mechanism exists where particles in the size range 8-20 microns, released from medical devices, are small enough to be phagocytosed by macrophages and transported to the lymphatics and subsequently to the vascular circulation but large enough to lodge in capillary beds of tissues remote from the implant site.",

A few of these collagen-graft-glycosaminoglycan copolymers (CG copolymers) have diverted decisively the kinetics and mechanism of skin wound healing in animals and humans away from contraction and scar synthesis, towards the direction of skin regeneration. Detailed animal studies show that CG copolymers show maximum biological activity when the average pore diameter and the degradation rate in collagenase are controlled within critical limits.  When seeded with a minimum number of cells these active copolymers induce regeneration of skin, including synthesis of a new epidermis and a new dermis in the correct anatomical relationship.  Certain unseeded copolymers have also induced regeneration of peripheral nerve. Another copolymer has induced regeneration of the knee meniscus. The unusual biological activity of these copolymers has led to extensive, successful clinical testing of novel medical devices for the treatment of skin loss with severely burned patients.",
        "During the use of collagen medical devices, some adverse clinical reactions occur involving both the cellular and humoral types of the immune response.  Thus, the development of immunoassay techniques for measuring the presence and the levels of circulating anticollagen antibodies is required.  The authors present their protocol:  it is a solid phase radioimmunoassay using collagen coated on polystyrene microplates and labelled protein A as the tracer. An example of the application of the technique is described. Anticollagen antibodies were monitored in 586 patients undergoing bovine collagen implant therapy.  In a retrospective study on 166 patients we found a good correlation between the presence of antibodies to collagen and cellular immune reactions such as a positive skin test or adverse clinical reactions after implantation. A prospective study on 420 patients showed that the pretreatment anticollagen serologic test can be useful as an adjunct to skin testing in the conservative management of patients desiring bovine collagen implant therapy.  The use of this double test allowed avoidance of any major clinical reaction and reduced minor signs of intolerance.",

The capsular polysaccharide adhesin (PS/A) has been shown to mediate attachment of bacteria to medical devices. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of active and passive immunization against PS/A in preventing S. epidermidis endocarditis in a rabbit model.\nAortic valve vegetations were produced by inserting a Teflon catheter into the left ventricle through the right carotid artery. Bacteremia and endocarditis were then established by implanting in the left jugular vein a catheter that was attached to an osmotic pump and contaminated with S. epidermidis strain RP62A. During a 3-week study period, of 64 blood cultures taken every second or third day from six nonimmune rabbits, 54 (84%) yielded strain RP62A. In rabbits actively immunized with PS/A, eight of 60 blood cultures (13%) were positive (odds ratio 5.0, 95% CI, 2.0-12.3, p = 0.005). At death, all six nonimmune rabbits had infected vegetations that yielded 10(6)-10(11) colony-forming units (cfu)/g of vegetation, whereas only one PS/A-immunized rabbit had an infected vegetation. Immunization protocols designed to elicit antibody to teichoic acid but not to PS/A afforded no protection against bacteremia or endocarditis. Infusion of monoclonal antibody to PS/A through a catheter in the right jugular vein provided a level of protection against both bacteremia and endocarditis comparable to that produced by active immunization. In vitro, antibody against PS/A was opsonic for S. epidermidis.\nImmunoprophylaxis targeted at staphylococcal PS/A is a promising new approach to the prevention of prosthetic valve endocarditis.",

Tubes became covered with a slimy accretion from the third day in place, independently of bacterial colonization, which was, in all but one cases, restricted to the rough areas of the tubes. Only Candida albicans and the corresponding slimy coat were found on smooth areas of tube. Cocci were noticed on 3 tubes. They were associated with the slimy accretion. Transmission micrographs elicited a thick material that was lying between cocci and polymer. These results showed that, on neonates' endotracheal tubes, accretion occurred independently of microbial colonization and that when colonization occurred, cocci adhered preferentially to a biological coat of human origin rather than the medical devices.",

        "The evolution of the laser as a medical device has been a process of continued improvement. Research into increasing our understanding of the optical characteristics of skin has made it possible to concentrate not on the effects of any particular laser system, but on basic biologic and physical principles of laser-tissue interaction. The lasers available in the 1960s and 1970s offered few possibilities for modification. However, modern technology allows us to manipulate the physical characteristics of lasers and design them for specific therapeutic purposes. Selective photothermolysis relies on chromophore-specific absorption of a brief pulse of light to generate and confine heat to certain targets within the skin without nonspecific thermal damage to adjacent structures. Thermally mediated target alterations can be confined from the level of large multicellular tissue structures (e.g., blood vessels) to individual microscopic pigmented structures (e.g., tattoo pigment granules). The purpose of this report is to describe the current progress being made and to summarize the present theories for achieving increasing selective removal, without scarring or other skin textural changes, of cutaneous vasculopathies and tattoo pigment by pulsed laser.",
        "Biomaterials are being used with increasing frequency for tissue substitution. Implantable, prosthetic devices are instrumental in the saving of patients' lives and enhancing the quality of life for many others. However, the greatest barrier to expanding the use of biomedical devices is the high probability of bacterial adherence and proliferation, causing very difficult and often untreatable medical-device centered infections. The difficulty in treating such infections results in great danger to the patient, and usually retrieval of the device with considerable pain and suffering. Clearly, development of processes that make biomedical devices resistant to bacterial adherence and colonization would have widespread application in the field of biomedical technology. A photochemical surface modification process is being investigated as a generic means of applying antimicrobial coatings to biomedical devices. The photochemical process results in covalent immobilization of coatings to all classes of medical device polymers. A discussion of the photochemical surface modification process and preliminary results demonstrating the success of photochemical coatings in formulating microbial-resistant surfaces are presented in this paper.",

        "Epidemics of mycobacteria due to contamination of medical devices continue to occur. For this reason, we assessed the ability of disinfectants, generally used in hospitals for disinfecting noncritical and semicritical patient care items, to inactivate mycobacteria. A modified Association of Official Analytical Chemists' (AOAC) Tuberculocidal Activity Test, using Middlebrook 7H9 broth as the primary subculture medium and neutralization by dilution, was used to assess the ability of 14 hospital disinfectants to inactivate about 10(6) Mycobacterium tuberculosis and about 10(5) Mycobacterium bovis at 20 degrees C using 10- or 20-minute exposure. All products were tested for each organism using 10 penicylinders (P) and were prepared at the manufacturers' recommended use-dilution. Chlorine dioxide, 0.80% hydrogen peroxide plus 0.06% peroxyacetic acid, and an iodophor achieved complete inactivation (0 + P) of both M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. One quaternary ammonium compound with a tuberculocidal label claim, a quaternary ammonium compound without a tuberculocidal label claim, chlorine (approximately 100 ppm) and 0.13% glutaraldehyde/0.44% phenol/0.08% phenate were not effective (10 + P) against both M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. Another quaternary ammonium compound with a tuberculocidal label claim was tested against only M. bovis and found ineffective (10 + P). Glutaraldehydes (2% alkaline and 2% acid), a phenolic and chlorine (approximately 1,000 ppm) demonstrated complete inactivation of M. tuberculosis (0 + P) and good inactivation of M. bovis (1-3 + P). Two disinfectants, hydrogen peroxide and ethyl alcohol, provided differing results against M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. These studies have important implications for disinfecting semicritical patient care items.",
        "We attempted to implement a nosocomial infection control program based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines in an urban Indonesian public hospital at the request of Project Hope. Adoption of unmodified CDC guidelines was impeded by a substandard physical plant, absence of an infection control infrastructure, limited sterilization capabilities, lack of clinical microbiologic laboratory support, and the expense of single use medical devices. After on-site evaluations, CDC guidelines were extensively modified so that they were appropriate for local conditions and culture. Strategies included inexpensive architectural modifications, addition of sinks and a commode, introduction of disinfection procedures for reuse of disposable medical devices, and adaptation of available supplies for maintenance of aseptic technique. On subsequent site visits, many physical changes had been accomplished, and handling of reusable and disposable medical devises had improved considerably but adoption of clinical practice policies was incomplete. We conclude that it may be difficult to implement and sustain improvements in clinical practice in the absence of an infection control infrastructure and a strong commitment by hospital clinicians and administrators. Additional research is needed to refine flexible methods for rapidly assessing the specific infection control needs of institutions with widely disparate resources, patient populations, environments, and cultures.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the Finapres digital probe with oscillometric and arterial line devices for recording blood pressures in low- and high-risk pregnant women. A total of 38 women were studied, including 24 with pregnancy-induced hypertension, two with chronic hypertension, two with cardiac disease, and ten who had no risk factors but requested epidural catheter placement. The comparison of Finapres or oscillometric recordings with direct arterial values confirmed that systolic recordings were imprecise for both devices (r = 0.80 and r = 0.64, respectively). Diastolic recordings (Korotkoff sound, phase 4) from the Finapres were accurate compared with the arterial values (r = 0.84). The Finapres performed at least as reliably as the oscillometric monitor in assessing blood pressure in our pregnant population and provided continuous measurements. When very accurate systolic recordings are needed, arterial catheter placement may be necessary.",
        "Rates of hospital-acquired staphylococcal infection have risen substantially in the United States over the last decade. Moreover, it has been shown that bloodstream infections caused by these organisms account for significant morbidity and mortality. It is likely that the changes in medical practice and in types of patient account for these changes, and current antibiotic therapy has helped select more resistant organisms. The increasing use of implantable and temporary medical devices and the increased use of immunosuppressive therapies correlate strongly with the rising incidence of these organisms. Likewise, more patients are predisposed to these infections because of poor immune status and factors favouring colonization. Intrinsic microbiological factors such as glycocalyx production and the presence of bacterial surface proteins allow these organisms to adhere to protein coated foreign bodies and basement membranes thus enabling them to initiate infection and cause disease. Moreover, virulence factors such as encapsulation, slime production and elaboration of extracellular enzymes aid their resistance to host defences. As a group, staphylococci are a leading cause of hospital-acquired infection, and species identification is required for both treatment and control.",

The Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (FDA/CDRH) collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics (CDC/NCHS) in the design and conduct of a nationwide medical device implant survey to generate the first national population-based prevalence estimates of orthopedic implant devices.  A Medical Device Implant Supplement to the 1988 National Health Interview Survey was administered in personal household interviews to a national sample of 47,485 households, which included 122,310 individuals.  An estimated 6.5 million orthopedic implants were in use in the general US population in 1988, including 1.6 million artificial joints and 4.9 million fixation devices.  As a group, orthopedic implants comprised nearly half of all medical device implants in use, 43.4%.  The majority of artificial joint recipients were 65 years of age or older, white, and male.  The majority of fixation device recipients were less than 45 years of age, white, and male.  The limitations and strengths of these population-based estimates are discussed.",

        "Polyurethane (PU) is a material used to make medical devices. During the gamma-ray or autoclave sterilization of these medical devices, PU degrades and a carcinogen, 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA), is produced. We studied a pretreatment method for MDA in blood serum by solid-phase extraction. Using Bond Elut C18, phenyl, and cyclohexyl columns, MDA in serum at a concentration of 0.1-10 ppm was 100% recovered with no apparent difference between the columns tested. Elution was carried out with methanol containing 1M MH4OH. The recovery rate of serum MDA with a Bond Elut C8 column was 90%, less than that from the above columns. The recovery of serum MDA from Bond Elut C1, C2, and silica was unsatisfactory. The recovery rate with Bond Elut SCX (strong cation exchange column) proved satisfactory, but the pretreatment of serum was troublesome as both deproteinization and centrifugal separation procedures were necessary in addition to the complicated conditioning procedure of the SCX column. There was no significant difference in recovery rate among C18, phenyl, and cyclohexyl columns, indicating that both pi-pi binding between benzene rings and van der Waals binding would be predominant. Because Bond Elut silica showed a lower recovery rate, the binding of NH2 in MDA with free silanol would not be predominant.",

Targets for opsonization remain unclear. Using radiolabeling techniques, we identified the surface-exposed proteins of ConS and determined the innate humoral immune responses to them among healthy adults. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of surface proteins extrinsically labeled with 125I demonstrated 20 to 30 proteins with molecular weights of 15,000 to greater than 130,000. Five to ten of these proteins were immunogenic and recognized by normal human sera, including predominant 18-, 41-, 48-, and 51-kDa proteins. We also evaluated the humoral response of cancer patients with ConS bacteremia. Patients' sera obtained before bacteremic episodes demonstrated a pattern of reactivity similar to that of normal human sera. When patients' sera obtained after bacteremic episodes were used to determine whether an expanded immune response followed infection, only one of seven showed reactivity with more proteins than seen with the innate response. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis and whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were also evaluated. This study identifies (i) the surface-exposed proteins available for host interaction, (ii) the innate human antibody response to these proteins, and (iii) the immune response of cancer patients with ConS bacteremia.",

        "One might believe that technological advancements, prophylactic antibiotic therapy, and ambulatory surgical trends would have appreciably altered infection statistics. Unfortunately, although economic pressures have shortened inpatient days and stimulated a major shift to outpatient surgical procedures, these changes did little to reduce surgical wound infection rates. Not only are they occurring more often, in more debilitated patients, but they are also becoming increasingly virulent, difficult, and costly to manage. When one considers the effects of surgical wound infection, and the added expense and inconvenience to both patient and hospital, it is logical to assume that OR nurses will take a proactive role in implementing new methods of prevention. The expanded role of the perioperative nurse specialist has helped to improve the quality of intraoperative care. Many positive clinical and technological changes in medical devices and infection control products have helped patient care. Any technological changes in the future must be made on the basis of a rational plan to improve patient care by decreasing surgical wound infection. Changes will occur on the basis of what is in the best long-range interest of the patient. The challenge for today's OR nurse, the medical community, and the health-care industry is to adapt to the needs of a rapidly changing health-care delivery environment. The future holds great promise. The expertise of the OR nurse, as clinician and manager, will be in greater demand as change continues to challenge professionals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "The adherence of bacteria to implanted medical devices is believed to be important in the development of implant associated infections. Measures which reduce bacterial adherence should reduce the incidence of these infections. However, in order to assess the importance of adherence, the effectiveness of methods to reduce adherence, and compare data from different laboratories, the conditions of the in vitro studies on adherence need to be specified. There are currently no correct and incorrect methods, however, methods used need to be carefully described. The studies reported here indicate that the definition of adherence needs to be established, with the use of polystyrene as the reference material recommended. Since the adherent organisms lose adherence traits with culture, cultures must be selected for adherence regularly. It is important to control the number of organisms/ml but the volume used is not important. The medium used to grow the organisms and the use of stationary, rocking or flow conditions will alter adherence and need to be specified and be consistent within a set of experiments. Culture conditions, methods of rinsing the material, methods of elution and counting, or direct counting of organisms on the material need to be specified. Finally, as much information as possible on the bulk and surface properties of the material should be provided. The handling of the material for the experiments should be careful and defined. Fingerprints, contact with protein, wet surfaces vs dry surfaces, etc., will all affect the subsequent adherence.

An increasing number of user errors is to be expected. Use of advanced computer technology can help avoid such errors. In this paper the system 'ALODIN' is presented which is developed in our institutions according to the IEEE standard 'Medical Information Bus' (MIB). ALODIN-I will be part of a CCCS (computerized critical care system) which is installed in the clinic for cardiovascular surgery at Medical School Hannover.",
        "Electric fields, which were equivalent to those generated by medical devices, were applied to cultured neuroblastoma cells (mouse and human) to test for morphological damage and to establish damage thresholds. Each of two methods of applying fields permitted flow of electrical current and minimized exposure of cells to electrode-breakdown products. One method consisted of a pair of parallel wires in a Petri dish by which current was delivered within a fixed volume of flowing tissue-culture media. With the other method, the cells were held in a confined geometrical chamber and current was applied via agar bridges. Under a given set of stimulation parameters, damage was found to be variable from cell to cell. By changing the strength of the electric field (frequency and duration of stimulation held constant), thresholds of several V/cm were found above which cell damage could be reliably produced. Depending on the intensity of the field, damage took the form of cell lysis or damage to neurites. Intracellular recordings from the mouse neuroblastoma cells revealed a correlation between a decline in resting transmembrane potential and stimulus intensity. Human neuroblastoma cells were less susceptible to damage than were the mouse neuroblastoma cells, given the same strength of applied electric fields.",

This article provides a general overview of technology assessment and relates recent trends and future prospects specifically to the use and evaluation of implanted medical devices.  In the next decade we may expect to see renewed interest in technology assessment as pressure to control health care costs continues and as a different focus of evaluation emerges that emphasizes patient preferences and quality of life in addition to traditional measures of safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness.  These pressures and forces will act to increase the visibility and importance of proper assessment of medical technology, and the field may more nearly achieve its early promise as a tool to make medical care more rational.",

        "Obstetrical technologies such as electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) and selected diagnostic imaging procedures can be integral components of perinatal care. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a unit within the Food and Drug Administration, collaborated with the National Center for Health Statistics in the design and conduct of a National Maternal and Infant Health Survey to collect information from prenatal care providers, hospitals, and mothers on the use of EFM, diagnostic ultrasound, and x-ray examinations during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. A pretest, conducted some months before the survey began, showed that 78.8% of the pregnancies surveyed received a diagnostic ultrasound examination during pregnancy. Approximately 58.3% of the ultrasound-exposed mothers had two or more such examinations. Approximately 10.1% of the ultrasound examinations were performed in the first trimester of pregnancy, 57.0% in the second trimester, and 32.9% in the third trimester. The most common indication for an ultrasound examination was to establish dates or gestational age. Approximately 15.3% of the pregnancies surveyed received an x-ray examination. Approximately 74.6% of the pregnancies were monitored with EFM during labor. External EFM was used alone during 54.9% of the labors and along with internal EFM during 19.7% of the labors. The implications of these pretest findings are discussed, along with a review of the medical literature on the safety and effectiveness of these medical device technologies.",

        "The effects of melt processing on those properties of polyhydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate copolymers that control hydrolytic stability were studied. Initial experiments using a non-thermal preparation technique enabled the relationship between initial molecular weight and rate of hydrolytic degradation to be established. This rate was conveniently expressed in terms of the time for 10% by weight of the sample to be eroded. By varying melt processing conditions, the range of effects of processing on sample molecular weight and molecular weight distribution were investigated. These effects were found to be quite dramatic, with a reduction to 50% of the initial molecular weight being readily achieved. Temperature, shear rate and dwell time interrelated to control the extent of thermal degradation achieved during processing. The principal effect of copolymer composition resulted from the fact that an increase in hydroxyvalerate content led to a reduction in melting point and enabled milder processing conditions to be used. Enhanced crystallinity, resulting from more favourable processing conditions reduced hydrolytic degradation rates. As a result, melt processing produced a complex interrelation of effects, all of which influenced the hydrolytic stability of the fabricated specimen. In general, molecular weight effects predominated.",
        "Batteries used in medical equipment, like their counterparts in consumer products, attract little attention until they fail to function effectively. In some applications, such as in emergency medical devices, battery failure can have fatal consequences. While modern batteries are usually quite reliable, ECRI has received 53 written problem reports and countless verbal reports or questions related to battery problems in hospitals during the past five years. This large number of reports is due, at least in part, to the enormous quality of batteries used to operate or provide backup power in contemporary hospital equipment. As part of an ongoing evaluation of rehabilitation assistive equipment, ECRI has been studying the performance of 12 V rechargeable deep-cycle lead-acid batteries used in powered wheelchairs. During the course of this evaluation, it has become apparent that many professionals, both clinical and industrial, regard batteries as \"black box\" devices and know little about proper care and maintenance--and even less about battery selection and purchase. Because equipment performance and reliability can be strongly influenced by different battery models, an understanding of battery characteristics and how they affect performance is essential when selecting and purchasing batteries. The types of rechargeable batteries used most commonly in hospitals are lead-acid and nickel-cadmium (nicad), which we compare below; however, the guidance we provide in this article focuses on lead-acid batteries. While the examples given are for high-capacity 12 V deep-cycle batteries, similar analyses can be applied to smaller lead-acid batteries of different voltages.",
        "Medical devices and diagnostic imaging procedures such as ultrasound, X-rays, and electronic fetal monitoring devices are used in the medical care of many pregnant women today. The responsibility for the safety and effectiveness of these diagnostic technologies is shared by a number of Public Health Service agencies, one of which is the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), a unit within the Food and Drug Administration. The CDRH collaborated with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in conducting a study of recent trends in the uses of diagnostic ultrasound, medical X-rays, and electronic fetal monitoring devices in the medical care of pregnant women. This study used data from the 1980 National Natality and Fetal Mortality Surveys and the 1987 pretest to the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey. Hospitals and prenatal care providers of the pregnant women contributed information regarding the use of these medical devices. Between 1980 and 1987, ultrasound use more than doubled, increasing from 33.5 percent of pregnancies in 1980 to 78.8 percent in 1987 (P less than 0.001). More ultrasound examinations were performed earlier in gestation in 1987 than in 1980, with 10.1 percent being performed during the first trimester in 1987, compared with 6.9 percent in 1980 (P less than 0.001). Use of external electronic fetal monitoring devices during delivery also increased significantly between 1980 and 1987, from 33.5 percent to 74.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Use of medical X-rays among women with live births remained relatively unchanged, 15.0 percent in 1980 and 15.3 percent in 1987 (P = .282). The implications of these trends are discussed.",
        "The Defibrillator Working Group of the Food and Drug Administration reviewed data from the Medical Device Reporting System and a recent five-state survey, as well as information presented at two Food and Drug Administration-sponsored conferences. These data include 156 reports of defibrillator problems to the Emergency Care Research Institute Problem Reporting Network, 495 reports of device problems to the Medical Device Reporting System, 676 reports of \"defibrillator failure\" in the five-state survey, 594 inspections of in-service defibrillators, and site visits to 212 emergency care facilities. The Defibrillator Working Group concluded that the frequency of defibrillator failures during clinical use may be unacceptably high. While some failures are attributable to component malfunctions, evidence suggests that errors in operator use and errors in defibrillator care and maintenance account for a high proportion of defibrillator failures. Inadequate initial training and cursory continuing education increases the chances of operator errors at the moment when correct operation is needed most. Failure of operators to perform daily equipment checks leads to poor familiarity with the equipment and failure to identify component failures or damaged devices. Many defibrillators and batteries are kept in service beyond an expected useful life, given their level of clinical use. In smaller hospitals and emergency medical services systems periodic maintenance responsibilities are not always appropriately delegated between qualified engineering personnel and defibrillator operators, and some systems completely lack services from clinical engineers. The objectives of the Defibrillator Working Group are to make personnel who use defibrillators more aware of the potential for errors in operator performance and in periodic maintenance and to recommend improvements in training, maintenance, and defibrillator design. This article presents the initial observations and recommendations of the working group.",

        "A hydrophilic polymer surface was developed exhibiting excellent low frictional property, namely slipperiness, when in contact with water or physiological fluid due to the reaction of epoxy-containing poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) with the polyamino compound formed on the surface of the substrate. Epoxy-containing poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) was obtained by the copolymerization of vinyl pyrrolidone as a hydrophilic component, glycidyl acrylate as a binding component to the substrate, and vinyl acetate to preserve the strength of the coating layer. The surface friction coefficient depends on the molecular weight of the coated hydrophilic copolymer. It was demonstrated that a molecular weight of 400,000 or more is essential to achieve excellent low surface friction. Using rabbit models, polyurethane catheters, both with and without the hydrophilic low friction coating, were evaluated for surface friction coefficient and blood compatibility. As a result, in the case of coated catheters, no lesions of the intima of the blood vessels and no thrombus formations on the surfaces of the catheters were observed. However, the non-coated catheters injured the intima of the blood vessels and severe thrombus formation was found on their surfaces.",
        "An intrathoracic, electrohydraulically actuated, left ventricular assist system (LVAS) was subjected to formal device readiness testing. Endurance testing was initiated on eight systems before testing was halted due to failure of four of the systems. Three failed due to environmental leakage. Solutions were straightforward, involving gasket changes and o-ring resizing. The fourth failure involved a magnetic coupling piston swelling and seizing. The failure was attributed, after long investigation, to hydrogen adsorption by the samarium-cobalt magnets. An unknown number of coupling magnets were affected in this fashion, necessitating complete replacement of magnets to resolve the problem. However, this was beyond the scope of the program, and no further endurance testing was accomplished. The test experience of the Nimbus/CCF LVAS has demonstrated all functional aspects of the complete LVAS, both in vitro and in vivo, and the endurance and reliability potential is indicated as well. Although the LVAS program is currently inactive, its legacy of technical innovations continue to drive the development of other medical devices.",
        "A process was developed to coat complex medical devices with a thin, transparent, biocompatible film. The film is based on silicone rubber (SR) but has higher albumin affinity than SR. Two polymer forms have been developed: one substitutes hydroxyl groups (OH), the other, 16 carbon acyl groups (C16) in the siloxane side chains. Oxymercuration/demercuration or hydroboration reactions can be used. SEM reveals film surfaces are smooth, uniform, and featureless. ATR/FTIR spectra and advancing/receding water contact angle measurements confirm the presence of surface OH groups and suggest the presence of surface acyl groups. Albumin adsorption and retention are markedly enhanced for surface OH and C16 concentrations as low as 5% reaction yield. Kinetics, isotherm, and competitive albumin/fibrinogen adsorption studies suggest that surface hydroxylation, and perhaps C16 acylation as well, markedly improve the albumin affinity, but not the fibrinogen affinity, of this material. The SR film can be durably coated on several materials, making it possible to favorably treat many blood-contacting devices, using a simple immersion process.",
        "Infection associated with medical devices may involve bacterial biofilms, a possible cause of antibiotic resistance. Protamine, a basic polypeptide, depresses the metabolic activity of Staphylococcus epidermidis in a standardized biofilm assay. The resistance of the biofilm preparations to many antibiotics, with the sole exception of rifampin, was confirmed. Rifampin produced predominant lysis and killing with foci of genetically programmed resistance. The combination of protamine with antibiotics produced no change, except the combination with rifampin where clear classic synergism with a totally bactericidal outcome was demonstrated. Protamine is a member of the larger family of charged polycations, some of which possess membrane potential altering properties, possibly interfering with the protective nature exhibited by the negatively charged bacterial biofilm matrix.",
        "Contraceptive development, including the development of IUDs, is discussed in light of the changing regulatory role of the FDA. The paper considers how the FDA and the government affect contraceptive development. Events that led to the demise of IUD use in the United States probably will have long-lasting effects on all future contraceptive development by the pharmaceutical industry in the United States.\nThe changing regulatory role of the FDA has affected the development of contraceptives including the IUD.  This work attempts to discuss how the FDA and the government influence contraceptive development.  Particular government actions led to the demise of the IUD in the US and will have long lasting effects in the US on the future of all contraceptive development by the pharmaceutical industry.  This work traces the history of government regulation of contraceptives from the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 through the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1962.  This act required manufactures of nonmedicated IUDs, and any other contraceptives, to conduct similar clinical trials that are required for the development of other drugs.  In the US, IUD contraception has become a legal battle ground and its future is that of a condemned product.  Currently no manufacturer of IUDs is marketing products in the US.  This deprives US women of a safe and effective form of contraception.  This work also discusses Depo-Provera and RU-486.   The author's final conclusion is that the future of contraceptive research and development in the US is in doubt.  The pharmaceutical companies of Western Europe have proven their commitment and ability in this area in the last decade and will continue to do so for the next.",

        "To determine when and why patients are placed in mechanical restraints, we surveyed the nurse and physician caring for each of 102 restrained patients from the general medical floors of an acute-care hospital. Ninety-three percent of the questionnaires were completed. Nursing questionnaires indicated that over half of patients were restrained during the evening shift. Nurses initiated the use of restraints in 75% of cases. Fifteen percent of the patients' physicians were unaware that the patient had been restrained. In the majority of cases, the nurse and physician believed that restraint was the best alternative for managing the patient although more physicians (11%) than nurses (2%) thought an alternative intervention would be better (P less than .02). As a group, physicians and nurses restrained patients for similar reasons, most often to prevent falls from bed (69%) or to protect medical devices (36%). However, there was poor agreement between the nurse and physician as to the reason for restraint in an individual patient (kappa statistic range from .02 to .43). These findings suggest that nurse and physician communication regarding restraint is poor. We recommend that acute-care hospitals adopt policies to promote communication between nurses and physicians concerning restraints to ensure that use of this potentially hazardous intervention is used only when necessary.",

Unfortunately, very little information is available regarding tests to detect such contaminants.

This article discusses the use and value of the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) test for estimating the concentration and extraction of bacterial endotoxins in disposable medical devices.  When bioburden-control procedures are applied to products manufactured to GMP requirements, batch testing of products for pyrogenicity may not be essential.",

        "In this issue, we evaluate two methods of providing safe, fire-resistant patient ventilation during laser surgery: ETTs marketed for use during laser surgery and wraps that can protect standard ETTs from laser energy under certain conditions. We evaluated five LRETTs from five manufacturers. The best protection from all types of laser energy to which we subjected the tubes - CO2, ND:YAG, and KTP - is offered by the Baxter Norton LRETT because it does not burn, although its use requires special ventilating techniques; it is rated Acceptable for all three types of laser surgery. Two other evaluated tubes provide protection from specific laser energies under limited conditions: the Bivona tube is rated Acceptable for CO2 laser surgery, and the Mallinckrodt tube is rated Acceptable for CO2 and KTP laser surgery. The Sheridan and Xomed tubes do not provide practical clinical protection and are rated Unacceptable. We also evaluated four wraps from three manufacturers. The Merocel wrap for standard ETTs, which is made of synthetic surgical sponge and adhesive-backed metal foil, is rated Acceptable and protects against typical surgical levels of CO2 and KTP laser energy. The Radio Shack metal sensing tape and 3M aluminum and copper foil tapes are rated Conditionally Acceptable for protecting against laser energy; they are Acceptable only on the condition that other means of laser protection are unavailable and alternative ventilation methods have been considered. These tapes are not marketed as laser-resistant wraps or FDA reviewed as medical devices; thus, users must assume full liability for a fire or any other adverse effects when using them. We recommend against using nonmedical metal tapes for most laser surgery on adults or larger pediatric patients since LRETTs or the Merocel wrap can be used for these applications. We further caution clinicians to base purchasing decisions for laser-resistant products on a thorough understanding of the issues behind our conclusions, which can be gained only by reading this evaluation in its entirety.",
        "The hydrolytic degradation of hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate copolymers was monitored in vitro at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4. Direct use of bulk properties such as weight loss and tensile strength did not reveal substantial changes in the polymer matrix over degradation periods of several months. Despite this, the polymers were demonstrated to undergo significant modification during this period, in ways that markedly influence their subsequent behaviour. Combined use of goniophotometry and surface energy measurements revealed that surface modification begins at an early stage and is accompanied by diffusion of water into the matrix and a progressive increase in polymer porosity. Relatively little change in the molecular weight and some increase in the crystallinity of the matrix occurred during these early months. As a result, the tensile strength of the polymer varies little in this period. As the porosity of the matrix increases, hydrolytic chain scission within the matrix and diffusion out of degradation products proceeds more effectively. Decrease in matrix molecular weight, increase in matrix erosion, weight loss and loss of tensile strength began at a much more dramatic rate. The apparent resistance of the polymer to degradation in the early months is followed by an accelerated degradation phase around and beyond 1 yr. The use of filters that can dissolve or hydrolytically degrade more rapidly than the hydroxybutyrate matrix accelerates the development of porosity within the matrix and thus enhances the decomposition process.",
        "During the past several years, the use of animals for toxicity testing has come under critical surveillance. For ethical and economic reasons, various techniques have been developed and proposed as potential alternatives for some of the whole animal toxicity assays. One assay proposed as an alternative to animal testing is the luminescent bacteria toxicity test (LBT), provided under the trade name of Microtox. The sensitivity and specificity of the LBT was compared with two commonly used toxicity tests--the L-929 Minimal E\u00e0gle's Medium (MEM) elution cytotoxicity test and the Draize test. Cytotoxicity and LBT test data from 709 medical device and biomaterial extracts were compared using a positive/negative ranking system which provided a measurement of false positive and false negative results. These data were compiled from nine separate laboratories producing or using a wide variety of biomaterials and medical device products. The LBT was more sensitive than the tissue culture assay and displayed few false negatives. LBT EC50 values were compared with eye irritancy categories for a group of 34 chemicals and 27 personal care products. As with tissue culture, the LBT was more sensitive and produced minimal false negatives. The data from this study indicate the LBT has potential as a rapid, simple method to screen biomaterials and personal care products for toxicity and irritancy.",

In view of the very large number of medical devices and current evidence of their unwanted effects there is a reason for the extension of such monitoring and licensing systems, complemented by self-regulatory mechanisms. Measures are also needed to ensure that when they enter the field devices are properly used and maintained. In various respects, the close analogy of pharmaceutical regulation can be applied.",

Practice, research, and nonvalidated practice, an intervention that falls into the region between pure practice and pure research, are defined and examined with respect to non-IDE use of unapproved medical devices. Two types of non-IDE use are considered: that which would be permitted under the feasibility studies mechanism, and emergency use. Ethical issues in both cases are discussed.

        "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle methods were used to examine the surfaces of an homologous series of poly(ether urethane) (PEU) samples before and after cleaning treatments. Four PEU films with Shore hardnesses varying from 45 to 75 D were studied as well as two commercially available intravenous catheters of related PEUs. The four as received PEU films have similar surface compositions (approximately 79% C, approximately 17% O, approximately 2% N, and approximately 2% Si) although they differ in bulk composition. Critical surface tension (gamma c) values are all similar and high (45-46 dynes/cm). The similarity in the surfaces of the four PEUs, despite the differences in their mechanical properties, demonstrates that surface properties do not necessarily reflect bulk properties. Soap washing and methanol-acetone extraction of the PEU films resulted in surfaces more representative of the bulk compositions of the PEUs. Analysis of the intravenous catheters confirmed that they are lubricated with PDMS, a common practice in the medical device industry. This study documents the value of detailed surface analysis for an enhanced understanding of the surface zone of PEUs. It also illustrates how cleaning protocols can remove labile surface species.",

The combined silicone-latex catheters and the latex procedure glove caused a pronounced complement activation and inhibited cell proliferation. However, the response ranging was opposite in the two assays, suggesting that different soluble factors were responsible for the observed reactions. No complement activation or inhibition of cellular proliferation was observed for the all-silicone catheter and the vinyl procedure glove.

Other components deal with the compliance of manufacturers with the marketing of medical devices within the meaning of the Act, and through labeling requirements of the Act and consumer education and informational activities. As for contact lenses, the process of updating product development regulations and guidelines is an ongoing activity. The most recent version of the Contact Lens Guideline Document, issued in April 1988, contains two major revisions involving preclinical and clinical testing. The first redefines plastics into one materials category, thus reducing testing requirements with respect to animal toxicology studies and other preclinical areas. The second revision restricts clinical testing requirements to allow confirmatory trials in applications for new daily wear lenses. The intention was to maintain the ability of studies to detect major material or design flaws in lenses, thus boosting confidence in their performance while eliminating unnecessary trials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
        "Medical devices are now a pervasive part of modern medical care. They are in many cases associated with quality of care. In some cases, the use of devices has certainly improved quality. In other cases, devices can be associated with many problems. The approach to quality of devices has depended largely on regulation. However, regulation of devices in Europe is rather undeveloped, so in many cases the reliability and safety of a device has not been independently established and one cannot assume that a particular device in fact is reliable or safe. In addition, there are many problems in the interface between the machine and the user or the patient that are largely untouched by device regulation, and perhaps should be more often considered in quality assurance programs. As essential as device regulation is, it is not sufficient to assure quality. Education is particularly important in this area. Quality assurance programs need to be familiar with common problems with medical devices and how to approach them.",
        "Manual recording of physiological data in patients receiving anesthesia or intensive care infrequently meets medical requirements or legal documentation standards. Automated recording allows the generation of reliable data that can be integrated into the patient's medical record. Such a system is beginning to function at University Hospital at Stony Brook, New York. Bedside medical devices (pulse oximeters, non-invasive blood pressure monitors, capnographs, infusion pumps and physiological monitors) from 18 operating rooms and 16 beds in the Anesthesia Intensive Care Unit are connected to a baseband Ethernet system. Data from the above devices are stored in a MicroVAX computer system. Data compression and interpretation, computation of derived values, statistical analysis of data from two related parameters are done by the bedside graphical microcomputer workstation. The MicroVAX computer and the workstation are also connected to the Ethernet system. The overall architecture of the automatic record system conforms to emerging standards for information exchange between bedside monitors and computer systems. Health care recipients and providers are likely to reap the benefits.",

        "The absence of standards for medical device communications has stymied the acceptance and success of automated clinical data management systems. Even devices with simple RS-232 data output ports require special interfacing hardware and software. Due to the number and variety of medical devices available, each with their own peculiar data output configuration, it has been impractical to interface with most of them. Limited by manual data entry, most computerized patient data management systems have failed to deliver the productivity gains their users expected. The forthcoming IEEE P1073 Medical Information Bus (MIB) Standard promises to correct this situation with a single powerful bedside device interface method. The MIB will provide specifications for all hardware and software necessary for medical data communications. The MIB handles the need for automatic recognition of new devices placed at a bedside, automatic reconfiguration of the network, binding of a device to a particular patient's bedside and many other issues unique to the medical data communications environment. The MIB is expected to undergo formal IEEE balloting in 1990 and promises to open a new era in data management for clinical patient care.",
        "Polyurethane (PU) is widely used in medical devices such as potting material in artificial dialysis devices, plasma separators, etc. Gamma-ray irradiation is frequently used for the sterilization of such devices. This paper reports that a carcinogen, 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA, p,p'-diaminodiphenylmethane), is produced from medical thermosetting PU by gamma-ray irradiation. Gamma-ray irradiated PU was immersed in methanol or equine serum. The serum was treated with a mixture of 5N HCIO4:acetonitrile (1:10) in order to deproteinate and recover MDA. It was found that MDA is formed from thermosetting PU at around a few ppm in the original sample. The production of MDA increased with increasing irradiation dose. The MDA amount formed was related to the irradiation dose by a second order equation. Results of methanol and serum extraction were similar. Pressurized steam (autoclave) sterilization in place of gamma-ray sterilization was also examined. MDA production was not found in autoclave sterilization procedures. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of methanol or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) extract of irradiated PU showed that the PU oligomers eluted. Time course of methanol extract of irradiated PU was detected at 245.5 nm. This showed an exponential decline regardless of doses of irradiation.",
        "The biocompatibility of three commercial copper-based dental casting alloys--Duracast MS, Goldent, and Trindium--three experimental copper alloys, and a control gold alloy, Modulay, were investigated. Trindium, Duracast MS, experimental alloys 1 and 2 are aluminum bronzes; Goldent is a hybrid aluminum-brass alloy; and experimental alloy #3 is a high zinc brass alloy. ASTM F813-83 Standard Practice for Direct Contact Cell Culture Evaluation of Materials for Medical Devices, a 3-day direct-contact cell culture regimen and atomic absorption spectroscopy were utilized for evaluating the biocompatibility of these alloys in both Waymouth's and RPMI 1640 complete media. Cellular proliferation assays, using 3H-thymidine uptake, were also conducted in Waymouth's media. In this investigation, only the experimental alloy #3 elicited alterations in morphology and viability of the fibroblast monolayer during the ASTM and 3-day culture tests in either media. Cell cultures exposed to experimental alloy #3 experienced copper concentrations greater than 16.0 ppm in Waymouth's and 10 ppm copper in RPMI 1640 media. Differences in the size of the cytotoxic zone around experimental alloy #3 were also observed, with the larger zone occurring in Waymouth's media. In contrast to the direct cell contact studies, all alloys caused decreases in 3H-thymidine uptake in Waymouth's media at much reduced metal ion concentrations as compared to the controls. Thus, adverse changes in DNA synthesis occurred at much lower copper and zinc concentrations than changes in morphology and viability. Consequently, the assessment of biocompatibility is dependent on the parameters evaluated, and several parameters must be analyzed before a material may be considered biocompatible.",

Some of these changes have been good for the public, whereas other changes are of questionable value. Conditions will never be as they were 25 years ago, but they could be closer to what was expected in 1976. As the FDA constantly seeks to improve its performance and Congress focuses on possible changes to the Act, the cardiovascular community of practitioners, inventors, and manufacturers should offer their assistance. I believe the creative spirit that enables you as pioneers to reflect on your accomplishments and contemplate even greater innovations for the future should again be applied to the process of helping the FDA improve the way it serves us--the public.",
        "Clinical decision models are intended to guide the choices of individual clinicians; policy models are intended to guide the choices of persons and organizations that affect the aggregate allocations of resources to health care problems. Although it is difficult to identify any single policymaker in the United States who can alter the aggregate effect of the millions (or billions) of individual clinical decisions, there are many potential users of policy models: payers, providers, state and local health departments, the National Institutes of Health, professional organizations, hospitals and producers of medical devices, among others. Policy models deal with populations of individuals, may be static or dynamic and may be descriptive or prescriptive. Two types of policy models that have been applied to cardiovascular disease with a focus on coronary artery bypass surgery are discussed: 1) economic evaluation models, specifically cost-effectiveness, cost utility and cost-benefit analyses; and 2) population simulation models. Cost-effectiveness models are preferable for reasons that are discussed.",
        "Biocompatibility of an implanted material, drug delivery system, or prosthetic is a dynamic two-way process that involves the time-dependent effects of the host on the material and the material on the host. Implantation of any synthetic material initiates a wound-healing mechanism that is characterized by the inflammatory response. We have developed a novel implant system that enables quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation of the inflammatory response to implanted materials. The cage implant system can be used to quantify the cellular and enzymatic components of inflammation and permits access to study cellular adhesion and interactions with candidate biomaterials. The basic methodology of the implant system is described. The effectiveness of the system is illustrated by comparing the results for three contrasting materials: polyethylene, poly(vinyl-chloride) containing a stabilizer that is cytotoxic, and poly(DL-lactide) containing hydrocortisone acetate.",

Evaluation of the potential toxicity of medical devices presents toxicologists with unique problems related to route of exposure, estimation of exposure dose, exposure to by-products generated during manufacture, and matrix effects. A symposium was organized to address the need for toxicologists to examine the potential toxicities of medical device materials, to appreciate the unique problems associated with medical device safety evaluation, to present novel testing methodologies, and to discuss future research needs.",

        "The hydrolytic degradation of poly(hydroxybutyrate)-poly(hydroxyvalerate) (PHB-PHV) copolymers in the form of blends with the polysaccharides amylose, dextran, dextrin and sodium alginate, has been studied under a range of conditions (pH 2.3, 7.4 and 10.6 and at 37 degrees C and 70 degrees C). The hydrolytic degradation of the PHB-PHV copolymers was found to be dramatically affected by the presence of polysaccharides. Its progress was characterized by an initial increase in the wet weight, with concurrent decrease in the dry weight as the polysaccharides eroded from the matrix. Surface energy measurements and goniophotometry proved to be particularly useful in monitoring this stage of the degradation process. The concurrent increase in internal porosity leads to the eventual collapse of the matrix, a process which occurs, but less rapidly, in the degradation of the unblended PHB-PHV copolymers. Information obtained from molecular weight and crystallinity studies enabled a comprehensive profile of the overall degradation process to be built up.",

        "Biological Indicators (B.I.'s) have traditionally been employed in the validation and routine monitoring of sterilization processes used for the manufacture and control of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In this paper, the phrase \"Endotoxin Indicator\" has been coined to describe a tool analogous to the BI which can be used in the validation and routine control of endotoxin reduction processes. Like the BI, the Endotoxin Indicator provides the user with an in vitro biological test to complement physical measurement used to control the manufacturing process. It must be remembered that the total pyroburden in an aseptically processed drug is the sum of the pyroburden of each factor contributing to the manufacture of that product. This includes raw materials, packaging components, the environment and the manufacturing process itself. Therefore, all aspects of the process must be considered for a complete validation. This pyroburden may also change during processing of a drug. Fluctuations in pH, solvent content, and temperature may decrease pyroburden while introduction of some raw materials, especially water, may increase endotoxin content. Regularly scheduled monitoring of all aseptic processes should identify and address each step of the process considered to have potential for the possible introduction or removal of endotoxin in the final product. Most of these situations can be thoroughly studied using Endotoxin Indicators to challenge routine production conditions, thereby providing insight to the assurance of endotoxin-free final products.",

        "Humans risk inadvertent intraperitoneal or intravenous exposure to formaldehyde (HCHO), commonly used for disinfection of implanted or extracorporeal medical devices. Various chemical and physical stresses are known to induce hepatic metallothionein. This study examined the effect of acute parenteral administration of HCHO on induction of hepatic metallothionein synthesis. Adult male CF1 mice were administered HCHO ip and hepatic metallothionein was quantified by the cadmium-radioassay method. HCHO (50 mg/kg) increased hepatic metallothionein as early as 8 hr after dosing with maximal levels (27-fold increase) occurring at 72 hr. Metallothionein concentrations were elevated (15-fold) 24 hr after 50 or 100 mg HCHO/kg but not at lower dosages. Concomitant elevations in hepatic zinc and copper content were observed. No increases in metallothionein were observed in kidney, pancreas, or intestine 24 hr after HCHO administration (100 mg/kg, ip). Induction of metallothionein by HCHO may reflect direct de novo synthesis since the response was abolished by pretreatment with the RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D. HCHO induction of metallothionein also does not appear to be mediated by stress-induced release of corticosteroids or catecholamines from the adrenal since the response was unaltered in adrenalectomized mice. Interference with the glutathione (GSH)-dependent oxidation of HCHO by reducing hepatic GSH concentrations to 40% of control after a 2-hr pretreatment with phorone decreased the metallothionein induction response to HCHO by 33%. This result suggests that the induction may be partially due to a HCHO metabolite, e.g., formate. Confirmation of metallothionein synthesis was obtained following spectral and chromatographic analysis. Thus, HCHO and/or a metabolite produces a marked increase in hepatic metallothionein and alters hepatic zinc and copper homeostasis, all of which are transient responses. Although HCHO was only mildly hepatotoxic at the highest dose (as evidenced by an increase in plasma alanine aminotransferase activity), such changes in metallothionein synthesis and essential metal homeostasis may be part of a cellular repair mechanism operant after acute toxic cell injury.",
        "The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs various commercial transactions. Article Two of the Code deals with sales of goods and, historically, has not applied to the provision of goods incident to rendering professional services. Recently, some courts have held professionals liable for economic or personal injuries caused by faulty medical devices and prostheses. Liability, when found, has been based on one or more of the UCC Article Two warranties. This article discusses these warranties and those cases in which hospitals and doctors have been held liable under them. While the number of such cases is small, there are arguments that suggest that liability under these circumstances could increase in the future. An understanding of the Article Two warranties and how they have been used in lawsuits against health professionals should help minimize the chances of successful litigation against dentists.",

He points out that current medical device design and manufacturing standards prevent clearly dangerous products from staying in the marketplace, creating the legal expectation that devices should be risk-free. A court that expects devices to be risk-free may misunderstand the inevitable adverse product reports that accompany rigorous product testing. Therefore, device manufacturers must anticipate and manage these misunderstandings during product development if they are to appear credible before the court. A framework for a preventive law plan to minimize the risk of punitive damage awards is presented.",
        "Regulatory and other public policy issues in the future of biomedical engineering, as they relate to the development and use of medical devices, are discussed. At the federal level, agencies that directly influence the application of medical technology include the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with its clinical trials and premarket and regulatory authority, and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), with its reimbursement policy. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Commerce can have a considerable impact on corporate profitability, which is a driving force for most new technology and new product introductions. Another area of public policy that has been cited as significantly influencing health care and medical device development, namely, civil litigation, is also considered. To illustrate the issues, the impact of the regulatory environment on the application of computer software to a wide variety of medical products is examined. The humanistic and ethical problems brought about by technological advances are discussed. Ten key technologies that are likely to have the greatest importance in the next few years and ten external influences on the future of the medical device technology industry that have been identified by the Health Industry Manufacturers Association are described.",

        "This article is the first in a series about the dilemmas posed by products-liability law. The authors point out that manufacturers of complex medical devices may have an unrealistic expectation about user expertise, the lack of which often causes injury to patients, thereby leading to litigation over the devices. The learned-intermediary problem arises when engineers and lawyers disagree over whether a device is designed for a sophisticated rather than unsophisticated user. The authors discuss why the law assumes that anesthesia machines are like lawnmowers, which are usually operated by untrained users, rather than airplanes. However, they argue that anesthesia machines, being complicated to understand as well as dangerous, are much more like airplanes. They conclude that medical-device manufacturers must develop strategies to assure that legally risky devices are restricted to competent users; otherwise, innovation will suffer and legal costs will destroy the competitiveness of the US medical device manufacturers.",

All ten strains showed in the fluid phase a variable pattern of sensitivity to seven antibiotics but were uniformly sensitive to rifampin and vancomycin. In the biofilm phase they demonstrated solid antibiotic resistance with the variable exception of rifampin. The nature of the milieu was a major variable. Fresh peritoneal dialysis solution enhanced the activity of rifampin but this effect was not present with spent or neutral dialysis fluids.",

It is essential to indicate whether polymeric implants are used in short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) applications. Relatively small changes in their physicochemical, mechanical, and biological properties may be tolerable in the short term, whereas similar changes may lead to catastrophic failures in long-term applications. Therefore, polymeric implants which are to be sterilized by high-energy irradiation should be carefully evaluated for long-term property changes which may be induced by the radiation.",

A vinyl-methyl silicone co-monomer was hydroxylated via an oxymercuration-demercuration reaction and then film-coated on a silicone rubber sheet. C16 acylation of the -OH coated sheet was carried out by an esterification reaction catalyzed by 4-DMAP. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of -OH groups following the hydroxylation reaction, and (CH2)n groups following the acylation reaction. 125I-labeled albumin binding studies indicated graded enhancements, according to reagent concentration, with maximal 2.7X and 2.5X increases for 20% -OH coated and 20% -OH/C16 acylated surfaces, respectively. Incubation with a protein denaturant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), removed 73% of adsorbed albumin from unmodified controls, with only 25 and 34% removal from 20% -OH coated and 20% -OH/C16 acylated surfaces, respectively. These results suggest that -OH and C16 modified surfaces not only preferentially adsorb albumin, but also retain it in a more stable configuration; this is an unexpected finding for -OH modified surfaces. Based on similar albumin affinities for biocompatible C18 alkylated and C16 acylated polyether polyurethanes, the authors expect significant improvements in thromboresistance and complement-activating potential for this modified silicone rubber.",

        "Deposition of calcium-containing apatite mineral occurs widely in association with cardiovascular and noncardiovascular medical devices and biomaterials, is the leading cause of failure of contemporary bioprosthetic heart valves, and limits the functional lifetime of experimental (and potentially clinical) mechanical blood pumps and polymeric heart valves. Calcification of bioprosthetic tissue is primarily intrinsic, related to cuspal connective tissue cells and fragments, and collagen. In contrast, the predominant site of calcific crystals on flexing polymeric surfaces in blood pumps or valve prostheses is extrinsic, associated with adherent cells, thrombus, or pseudointima. Pathologic calcification shares key features with physiologic skeletal mineralization, including crystal initiation through the mediation of cell membranes, usually in the form of extracellular vesicles. This suggests a unified hypothesis for normal and abnormal mineralization. Several approaches are being studied experimentally for the inhibition of bioprosthetic heart valve calcification. Controlled-release diphosphonate therapy, perhaps in conjunction with an anticalcification cuspal pretreatment, appears most effective. Research objectives in biomaterial-associated calcification include (1) development of animal models, (2) determination of initial crystal nucleation events and sites, (3) elucidation of the relative roles of host, implant, and mechanical determinants, and (4) development of approaches for the inhibition of mineralization.",

        "Health care costs continue to skyrocket, and a large portion of these costs can be attributed to technology. Some technology, such as oximetry, is relatively inexpensive compared to CAT scanning and magnetic resonance imaging. Therefore, it may elude close scrutiny and direct health care planning and, with little fanfare, drive up costs. Many of the new respiratory monitors and ventilators have not yet been subjected to the basic question: Do they affect morbidity and mortality? Technology assessment in this country is fraught with duplication of effort and complexity; the system is fragmented and in need of a strategic approach to equipment evaluation. There is meager information on cost analysis and little consensus on what needs to be done about the ethical dilemmas created by technology. Respiratory care practitioners have a significant role to play in medical device evaluation. Problem reporting of serious equipment malfunctions to the U.S. Pharmacopeia and manufacturers is essential. In-house product evaluation prior to purchase is prudent. Important feedback can be given to manufacturers through testing of prototype equipment, with the end result that our needs are met. Small departments may need to rely on information that is currently available. Laboratory and clinical research must be conducted to provide a scientific basis for the use of technology. Adequate assessment requires knowledgeable people in a position to perform the essential tasks. Respiratory care practitioners are a logical group to take an active role in the important tasks of thoroughly assessing the technologies we use.",

        "Several PVC medical devices contain the plasticizer Di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) in high concentration. Taken systematically DEHP only has minor toxic effects in the human organism. In three preterm infants artificially ventilated with PVC respiratory tubes unusual lung disorders resembling those observed in hyaline membrane disease, verified both clinically and radiologically, were observed during the fourth week of life. It was assumed that these lung disorders were causally related to the exposure to high doses of DEHP, which was released from the walls of the respiratory tubes. DEHP was found in the lung tissue of one patient who died of pneumothorax soon after birth after being artificially ventilated. It is strongly recommended that for disposable PVC respiratory devices the plasticizer DEHP should be used with more restrictions.",
        "The marketing concept says that a firm should focus all of its efforts on satisfying its customers, at a profit. This is really a a new philosophy of business, replacing a production-oriented philosophy which focused on organizing a firm's resources to make products and then selling them. The marketing concept calls for reorienting the firm's ways of doing things. Instead of trying to get customers to buy what the firm has produced, a marketing-oriented firm would try to sell what the customers want. The underlying principle of the marketing concept is that a firm should seek to meet the needs of customers, at a profit, rather than place its main emphasis on its own internal activities and utilization of its resources. These latter factors are also important, of course, but those who believe in the marketing concept feel that customers' needs should be the firm's primary focus and that resources should be organized to satisfy those needs. Give the customer what he needs--this may seem so obvious and logical that it is difficult to understand why the marketing concept is considered such a breakthrough. However, people haven't always done the logical and obvious. In a typical company, production men thought mainly about getting the product out. Accountants were only interested in balancing the books. Financial people were absorbed in the company's cash position. And salesmen were mainly concerned with getting orders. No one was particularly concerned with whether the whole system made sense. As long as the company made a profit, each department went merrily on its independent way, \"doing its own thing.\" Unfortunately, they still do in the majority of companies today. Finding out customer's attitudes can avoid prejudices and stereotypes commonly found in the typical organization. The need for market research to avoid stereotypes can be dramatized by the following results from a large-scale survey of European adults: The average Frenchman uses almost twice as many cosmetics and beauty aids as his wife. The Germans and the French eat more spaghetti than the Italians. French and Italian housewives are not as interested in cooking as their counterparts in Luxembourg and Belgium. No firm can conduct its business successfully without trying to measure the actual size of markets, present and future. Quantitative measurements are essential for the analysis of market opportunity, the planning of marketing programs, and the control of marketing effort. The firm may make many measures of demand, varying in the level of product aggregation, the time dimension,a nd the space dimension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "Historically, the fatigue behavior of materials and structures, including biomaterials and implant devices, was analyzed using stress-life (S-N) techniques, i.e. by determining the number of cycles to failure at a calculated peak stress. The development of fracture mechanics technology has made the crack-growth aspect of fatigue analysis a more exact science, providing more precise data on the properties of materials, incorporating more geometric and metallurgical information from the structure, and, in some cases, providing for updated in-service lifetime predictions. Over the past decade, the medical implant industry and researchers have adopted this analytical tool to varying degrees. The result has been the development of some improved materials, operative procedures, and devices, based on a more exact knowledge of the properties most critical to assuring the long-term durability of devices. Examples of the application of fracture mechanics technology to orthopedic and cardiovascular devices and the potential for further applications are reviewed.",

Similarly, pathologists can offer a clinico-pathologic assessment of the efficacy of health care technology. Assessment by pathologists has diagnostic authority because it draws on the resources of the laboratories of surgical and necropsy pathology. In this essay we argue for enhancing the accuracy of medical device and biomaterials technology assessment by systematically collecting pathology-oriented data. We recommend the establishment of a pathology-based medical device registry to assess implantable medical device technology by accumulating reports routinely issued by pathology departments throughout the country. We further suggest that establishment of a university-based, industry-supported Medical Device and Biomaterials Pathology Institute to operate the registry, collect recovered, used health care devices, and generate definitive, pathology-based, primary data for health care technology assessment.",

Moreover, the knowhow obtained from research must be protected long enough to enable the industry to complete development and market the product.",
        "The primary objective of decontamination is to protect healthcare workers who handle medical devices from infectious diseases that may be present on those devices. Ideally, the decontamination process should provide both cleaning and biocidal activity. A wide range of equipment, from automatic washer/sterilizers to semi-automated washer/sanitizers are commercially available to satisfy this need. The primary difference between these pieces of equipment, from a microbiology perspective, is in the level of safety they provide. A summary comparison of the decontamination methods is shown in Table 1. Without a doubt, steam sterilization as a method of decontamination provides a greater safety level than may be required. However, the question is, \"Do disinfection and sanitization provide an adequate safety level?\" Although items do not necessarily need to be sterile to be safe to handle, sterilization processes provide the greatest margin of safety because of the significant microbial lethality and the ability to effectively monitor the process via biological indicators. Sterilization effectively eliminates the concern regarding the nearly unanswerable question of bioburden. Unfortunately, not all items are capable of being processed through a washer/sterilizer. Therefore, consideration must be given to the process compatibility of each device. Disinfection processes provide the next level of safety. Unfortunately, there is no recognized or accepted method for quantitatively describing or monitoring a thermal disinfection process. As is the case with sterilization consideration must be given to the process compatibility of each device. Sanitization provides the lowest level of safety for the decontamination process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
        "Clinical studies performed by us and others have found an association between slime production and strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci that infect indwelling medical devices. By serial low-speed centrifugation of broth cultures we have isolated a stable, weakly adherent strain (RP62A-NA) from a strongly adherent, slime-producing, pathogenic strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis sensu stricto (RP62A, ATCC 35984). We obtained a second strain from RP62A-NA (RP62A-NAR) by serial subculture of glass-adherent cells of RP62A-NA. All three strains had the same pattern of biochemical reactions, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and plasmid analysis. Transmission electron micrograph sections stained with the mucopolysaccharide-specific stain alcian blue demonstrated that the adherent strains RP62A and RP62A-NAR were covered with an extracellular coat of polysaccharide-rich material. In contrast, the nonadherent RP62A-NA strain lacked this external coat. All three strains were used in a mouse model of foreign body infection and a rat model of catheter-induced infective endocarditis. The adherence characteristics of isolates of RP62A and RP62A-NA recovered from experimental animals were relatively stable, although we noted a slight but a significant increase in the adherence of RP62A-NA isolates recovered from the foreign body model. The adherence characteristics of RP62A-NAR isolates recovered from infected animals were variable; in general these isolates were less adherent than the laboratory strain of RP62A-NAR. In both models the 50% infective dose (calculated by the Reed and Muench method) was three times greater for the RP62A-NA strain than for the RP62A strain. The phenotypic expression of slime production is subject to both in vitro and in vivo variation and could play a role in the pathogenesis of foreign body infection.",

        "The emergence of recombinant DNA technology in the 1970s has given rise to new diagnostic techniques based on DNA probes. The Food and Drug Administration's interest in these probes stems from its regulatory responsibilities regarding DNA probes as medical devices. The agency also sees DNA probes as valuable tools in meeting its mission of identifying, preventing, and resolving public health problems, especially in the area of food safety. The development of DNA probes for genetic diseases is raising medical and ethical questions that must be addressed by the medical community, whose ultimate responsibility must be to see that this new technology is used wisely, appropriately, and correctly.\nThe author writes about DNA probes, a spin-off technology from recombinant DNA research, from two perspectives:  that of a physician, and that of the federal Commissioner of Food and Drugs.  Young discusses the Food and Drug Administration's role in regulating DNA probes, as well as the agency's interest in using the probes to confront public health problems such as food pathogens.  He also comments on some aspects of molecular biology's growing role in medicine.  Young emphasizes that the FDA's responsibility for regulating DNA probes is limited, and that the medical community is obligated to ensure that the probes are used appropriately as diagnostic aids, particularly when screening for genetic disease.",
        "Ethylene oxide is a major industrial chemical used primarily as an intermediate in the manufacture of other chemicals; e.g., ethylene glycol, a major component of automotive and other antifreeze products. Exposure to ethylene oxide is greatest in the health care industry, where an estimated 75,000 workers are potentially exposed. Ethylene oxide was nominated for toxicology and carcinogenesis studies in B6C3F1 mice because of its extensive production; the potential for human exposure in the workplace, from medical devices, or from food; the positive results of genetic toxicology assays; and the previous use of only F344/N rats in inhalation carcinogenicity studies. Two inhalation studies reported in 1984 by Snellings et al. and by Lynch et al. demonstrated carcinogenic responses in F344/N rats. Results were similar in both studies and consisted of increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia, peritoneal mesotheliomas, and primary brain tumors. Experimental Design: Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of ethylene oxide (greater than 99% pure) were conducted by exposing groups of 50 B6C3F1 mice of each sex to air containing 0, 50, or 100 ppm ethylene oxide, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 102 weeks. These doses were selected because, in 14-week studies, all mice exposed at 600 ppm died within 1 week, and all mice exposed at 400 ppm died by week 4. Rhinitis was observed in both sexes exposed at 200, 400, and 600 ppm as was renal tubular degeneration in both sexes at 100, 200, and 400 ppm. The latter effects observed at 100 ppm were slight and deemed not to be life threatening in 2-year studies. Two-Year Studies: Survival of exposed and control mice was comparable in the 2-year studies (male: control, 28/50; low dose, 31/50; high dose, 34/50; female: 25/50; 24/50;31/50). Final mean body weights in exposed mice were 95%-102% of those of the controls. No compound-related clinical signs were observed. Those neoplastic lesions that occurred at elevated incidences in mice exposed to ethylene oxide are reported in the following table (see page 6 of the Technical Report). In male mice, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, and papillary cystadenomas of the harderian gland occurred with positive trends. In female mice, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas, papillary cystadenomas of the harderian gland, malignant lymphomas, and uterine adenocarcinomas occurred with positive trends. Mammary gland tumors also were increased in exposed female mice. Data Audit: An audit of the experimental data was conducted for the 2-year studies of ethylene oxide. No data discrepancies were found that influenced the final interpretations. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for B6C3F1 mice as indicated by dose-related increased incidences of benign or malignant neoplasms of the lung and benign neoplasms of the harderian gland in both male and female B6C3F1 mice following exposure to ethylene oxide vapors at 50 and 100 ppm. In female mice, ethylene oxide caused additional malignant neoplasms of the uterus, mammary gland, and hematopoietic system (lymphoma).

        "This study examines the influence of the properties of various vascular graft materials on the bacterial adherence process of two different strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis (mucous and normucous producing). Dacron grafts (both knitted and woven), Teflon grafts, and Dacron grafts coated with one and two layers of silicone were studied because these materials differ significantly in porosity, hydrophobicity, and surface charge (zeta potential). Graft segments were immersed in 3H-labeled bacteria solution for periods ranging from 5 to 180 minutes and liquid scintillation techniques were used to quantify bacterial adherence. The porous knitted Dacron material had a significantly higher rate of bacterial adherence than either the woven Dacron or Teflon (p less than 0.05). Silicone coating (either one or two layers) reduced adherence by a factor of four for the knitted Dacron (p less than 0.05) and by a factor of two for woven Dacron (p less than 0.05). The mucous producing strain of S. epidermidis displayed significantly better adherence to woven and knitted Dacron than the normucous producing strain, but only when 0.25% dextrose was added to the bacteria solution. These findings indicate that the highly porous knitted Dacron grafts have the highest propensity for bacterial adhesion. Graft materials with the most negative zeta potentials are more resistant to bacterial adherence. Silicone coating of Dacron material significantly changed adherence characteristics, suggesting that this may be a viable strategy for protecting implantable medical devices containing materials to which bacteria readily adhere.",

Only 38% of hospitals that regularly reused had written procedures for reuse, and 32% indicated a mechanism for determining the number of times a device was reused. Cost analysis studies had been undertaken by only 29% of regular reusers, and items of respiratory therapy equipment were the most commonly reused devices.",
        "Extracorporeal medical devices such as the hemodialyzer rely on systemic heparinization to prevent thrombus formation. Heparin, however, can lead to serious hemorrhagic complications. A blood filter containing immobilized heparinase, a heparin specific enzyme, was used to degrade heparin into small fragments which have significantly less anticoagulant activity than the parent compound. The heparinase filter was tested in the extracorporeal circuit during the hemodialysis of adult sheep. At a blood flow of 200 ml/min, the clearance of heparin varied from 50 to 70 ml/min (N = 16) depending on the amount of immobilized heparinase in the filter. Hemolysis was insignificant as measured by the animals' red cell counts, hematocrit, total hemoglobin and a plasma-free hemoglobin value of 89 +/- 33 mg/dl (N = 16) (less than 1% of the total hemoglobin). The white cell counts dropped to 47 +/- 7% (N = 16) of the initial value at 20 minutes and rebounded to 72 +/- 10% (N = 16) after one hour. The platelet counts decreased to 55 +/- 8% (N = 16) of the initial value after one hour. No change in heparin clearance was observed when reactors were used repeatedly in adult sheep over a 10 week period. The red cell counts, white cell counts, platelet counts, total hemoglobin and hematocrit did not change after 10 weeks of exposure to the device. These results suggest that with further study, heparinase may be useful in removing heparin used to anticoagulate blood in extracorporeal circuits.",

        "The syntheses of anhydrosulphite and anhydrocarboxylate derivatives of tartronic acid are described. These compounds, more correctly named 5-carboxy-1,3,2-dioxathiolan-4-one-2-oxide and 5-carboxy-1,3-dioxolan-2,4-dione have been shown to undergo polymerization and copolymerization to poly-alpha-esters containing the tartonic acid residue, characterized by the presence of a pendant carboxyl group. Thermal polymerization of the anhydrosulphite appears to proceed in a substantially identical manner to other members of the series in which the monomer decomposes by a first order process to yield an alpha-lactone which polymerizes by a rapid chain growth reaction. Because the rate of thermal polymerization of tartronic acid anhydrosulphite is much more rapid than simple alkyl substituted anhydrosulphites, copolymerization favours the former residues. More successful copolymerization was achieved by the use of tertiary base initiators and the anhydrocarboxylate derivative of tartronic acid. The polymers and copolymers described are of potential value in the synthesis of drug-carrying biodegradable matrices or more hydrophilic analogues of poly(glycolic acid) which combine the known bioerodibility of the moiety with that presence of a pendant carboxyl group.",
        "Although silicones, as a class, are nontoxic in animal and tissue studies, implanted silicone prostheses and medical devices are associated with various local and systemic host inflammatory reactions. They also have been associated with a form of autoimmune disease. To test the hypothesis that silicones may evoke an immunologically mediated inflammatory reaction, 10 guinea pigs were stimulated for 1 month with intraperitoneal injections of sterile medical-grade silicone oil admixed with homologous serum and complete Freund's adjuvant. Ten controls were stimulated with saline. Four additional animals were passively sensitized with splenic homogenates from four sensitized animals. Intradermal antigenic challenges consisted of silicone-homologous serum, pure silicone, saline-homologous serum, and purified protein derivative. Cutaneous reaction patterns were graded grossly and microscopically. Silicone-serum and purified protein derivative antigens evoked three to four times greater palpable lesions in all 10 actively and all 4 passively sensitized animals at approximately 24 h compared to controls. Biopsies showed a moderate to marked lymphocytic infiltrate. Control sites and naive animals showed only edema at the challenge sites.

Biosensors can be configured into simple, rapid, and cost-effective laboratory devices that will allow the clinical pathologist to become even more responsive to the primary care physician. In those instances where measurements on discrete samples do not provide the required information, continuous monitoring with implantable biosensors could provide real-time data on levels of critical endogenous or exogenous substances.

        "Since its commercial release, Zyderm collagen implant has been used to treat more than 200,000 subjects in the United States for soft-tissue contour defects and more than 250,000 patients internationally (including the United States). Approximately 3 percent of subjects' skin tested with Zyderm collagen experience localized hypersensitivity reactions to collagen, whereas approximately 1 percent of treated patients demonstrate symptoms of hypersensitivity at treatment sites. Of the latter treatment responses reported since the conclusion of clinical trials with Zyderm, 56 percent occurred following the first treatment, 28 percent following the second, 10 percent following the third, and 6 percent following subsequent exposures. The data indicate that most patients receive a median of three treatments (mean = 4.4) with Zyderm collagen, but most patients who are likely to develop sensitivity to Zyderm collagen appear to respond immunologically to the test implant or first treatment exposure. Examining these treatment responses, 45 percent of the patients reported an onset of symptoms within 10 days and 22 percent at more than 30 days following the last treatment with Zyderm collagen. Erythema was the sole symptom in 24 percent of cases, whereas erythema plus induration comprised an additional 42 percent. Antibodies against Zyderm collagen were detected in the sera of 88 percent of these subjects using an ELISA, but no reactivity was observed against human collagen. Sera from patients reporting only systemic symptoms were not found to have anticollagen antibodies. These data suggest that the relative risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to Zyderm collagen does not increase with multiple exposures, since patients who are going to develop an immune response to bovine collagen react with greatest frequency to initial injections of collagen. In animal models, Zyderm collagen was shown to be less immunogenic than other medical devices which are composed of bovine collagen. Specifically, comparative studies were conducted in which Zyderm collagen and hemostatic agents were implanted in the guinea pig subcutaneum: sera from animals treated with collagen-derived hemostatic devices possessed significant levels of anti-implant antibodies (titers greater than 640), whereas animals treated with Zyderm collagen mounted minimal responses (titers less than 40). Additional studies were conducted in which implant materials were compared in a guinea pig parietal (bony defect) model and in a rabbit hemostasis model: in both, Zyderm collagen demonstrated lower immunogenicity than commercial bovine collagen hemostatic agents.

        "A large increase in medical products liability litigation during the past 40 years has resulted in a flood of litigation against drug and device manufacturers. The medical technology and chemical industries are prime targets for products liability litigation. Physicians and other health care providers are willing to accept a reasonable degree of risk associated with the use of a medical product when compared to the benefit to be achieved by that product but lay juries are less likely to tolerate the concept of an acceptable failure rate. Plaintiffs' lawyers believe that the medical products industry should be held to a standard of absolute liability and that anyone injured by a medical product is entitled to recover without regard for the circumstances. Large compensatory and punitive damage awards, the high cost of insurance, large defense costs, and low profit margins have forced some companies to remove their products from the market.

Medical publishers in the USA today primarily are parts of larger, nonmedical publishing corporations, and the nonmedical publications are affecting the medical publications.

The publication of symposia proceedings supported entirely by grants from single pharmaceutical or medical device companies in otherwise peer-review journals is increasing. It is better, in my view, for physicians not to exert efforts to discontinue this practice, which is here to stay, but to exert their influence to reduce excess bias and overstatement.

They need our strong support. They need to be published on acid-free paper which will not deteriorate, for they are the permanent record of our information. We need more editorial pages in the peer-review subscription journals so that more review and experimental-type articles can be published, and less pages in the 'throw-away' journals which diminish support available to the peer-review subscription journals.",
        "Increasing numbers of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are contracting with the federal government to permit enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries, and increasing numbers of the elderly are joining HMOs. A review of past HMO performance suggests that, although these organizations will try to effect a decrease in the rate and duration of hospitalization to control costs, a high rate of functional disability and acute illness in elderly patients will make it impossible to accomplish this significantly. Also, although HMOs will attempt to provide more comprehensive coverage, the demand for prescription drugs, eyeglasses, and medical devices will make such coverage very expensive. Attempts to ration the services of primary-care physicians will impede case management and continuity of care. If HMOs are to provide high-quality medical care at a reasonable cost, they will need to consider making use of geriatric assessment units, geriatric consultants, geriatric nurse practitioners, and special geriatric hospital wards.",

It was only in the nineteenth century that advances in diagnosis, marked by the invention of the stethoscope, and in therapy, denoted by the introduction of ether anesthesia, inaugurated the era of modern medicine. Over the century and a half that followed, we developed an extra-ordinary armory of diagnostic and therapeutic tools, which have significantly improved life expectancy and raised the quality of life for countless persons all over the world. These advances also have created ethical, economic, organizational, and political problems concerning their appropriate use and distribution.",

Since the 1890s, hospitals processed, packaged, and sterilized most of the medical-surgical items they needed in their own sterile supply departments--a \"cottage industry\" developed specifically for recycling. Only those consumable items that were too difficult, expensive, or inconvenient to reprocess were purchased from outside manufacturers as presterilized, single-use \"disposables.\" Since the plastics revolution, however, the \"disposables\" started to displace the \"reusables,\" and while claiming to be an economical innovation, have become a significant item in the budget. Some hospitals feel that if disposables save money, reusing the disposable several times will save more. The practice is spreading. The manufacturers, in turn, claim that hospitals do not have adequate quality assurance programs or skills to reprocess their items properly. The debate is further complicated by legal and ethical ramifications, as well as commercial and economic arguments.",

        "In December 1984, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Dornier Systems (FRG) approval to market the external shock wave lithotripter (ESWL) in the USA. The Medical Device Amendments of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act require that the FDA evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for commercial distribution in the U.S. Such evaluation includes basic scientific studies, animal testing, and investigational studies in human subjects, culminating in a judgment concerning acceptable risks in terms of anticipated benefits, and whether the device is effective for its intended use. Prior to human studies in West Germany, Dornier had evaluated the destruction of stones of varying composition, measured the rate and energy of stone destruction, and tested blood samples and lymphocyte cultures exposed to shock waves. In addition, studies in both rats and dogs had demonstrated the feasibility of the technique and evidence of safety. Such data are provided by manufacturers when applying for an investigational device exemption (IDE) from the FDA, which permits clinical studies in humans; such studies also require the approval of an Institutional Review Board. The FDA approved Dornier's IDE, allowing human investigational use of the ESWL in facilities in the U.S., conducted concurrently with similar studies in West Germany. Upon completion of clinical trials, data acquired in vitro, in laboratory animals, and in human investigations are submitted to the FDA for a premarked approval application (PMAA). The Agency was given 6 months to make a decision, taking into consideration the recommendation of an advisory panel of experts from outside the Agency who had reviewed the same data. In its evaluation of the ESWL for safety and effectiveness, the FDA considered the question of alternative practices and procedures to treat nephrolithiasis, including percutaneous nephrolithotomy and open surgical procedures, and the adverse effects of such procedures. Clinical data available at the time of review for approval included reports of treatment of 667 patients in West German centers, and 327 patients treated in three U.S. facilities. Dornier and the FDA initiated discussions concerning the labeling of the device and a postmarketing surveillance plan. These were completed and marketing approval for the ESWL was granted.",

While media attention has focused on the revolutionary advances, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and metabolic assessment by positron emission tomography, important progress has also been made in the more conventional modalities, including contrast radiography, ultrasound, scintigraphy and mammography. These evolutionary developments have produced fundamental changes in the character of imaging information and in the methods of its acquisition, storage, manipulation, analysis and display. The assessment process-vis-\u00e0-vis safety, effectiveness, efficacy or cost-has moved from a previously well-defined physical and engineering evaluation to one of assessing quality, relevance and appropriateness of the \"information.\" A regulatory scheme has evolved in the U.S., whereby the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for assuring that new medical devices be approved for commercial distribution only if their safety and effectiveness can be assured.

The role of clinical engineering in diagnostic risk management must be consistent with its general obligations in equipment acquisition, training, maintenance, and hazard identification.

Generally, aeration was confirmed to be a diffusion-controlled process. Diffusion coefficients of EO for the investigated materials were determined from the rates of desorption. For a number of materials the EO content appeared to be well above the levels for EO which currently are considered to be safe, even after aeration for 15 d. For a reliable determination of aeration times required for EO-sterilized medical devices, the type and in particular also the thickness of the material from which the device is made should be considered.",

A review of 10 new Class II and III devices found an average of 62 months elapsing between the beginning of FDA-approved clinical trials and the device's final approval for general marketing. However, FDA marketing approval does not mean a new device can be sold because, for many new devices, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) requests a technology assessment from the Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA) in order to determine whether the device's use is \"reasonable and necessary\" and thus appropriate for Medicare payment. The Medicare decision often guides other third parties. OHTA assessments of 93 devices and procedures required an average of 26 months to complete; of 16 FDA-approved Class III devices, OHTA reported to HCFA that insufficient data existed to recommend coverage for 12 (75 percent). Under the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for hospital care, a third step has been added to the process, consideration by the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) and HCFA of the new device's impact on PPS payment rates. Further, under recent legislation, OHTA is mandated also to consider a device's cost effectiveness.

        "In order to impart flexibility, plastic medical devices incorporate liquid plasticizers into their structure. Data from several laboratories, including ours, have shown that these compounds leach from blood bags and tubing during collection of blood, storage of various blood components and during kidney dialysis and cell and plasma apheresis procedures. After the plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate leaches from poly(vinyl chloride) blood packs, it is converted by a plasma enzyme to a more toxic metabolite, mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. Blood fractionation products from outdated plasma contain mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, the highest level being found in normal serum albumin. Recently, we have reported that di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate actually binds to the red blood cell membrane and reduces its osmotic fragility. Current methods of red cells storage, which permit utilization up to 35 days after collection, are not possible without this membrane stabilization. Platelets are now stored for 5 days in the Fenwal PL 732 polyolefin bag. Although stated to be essentially free of liquid plasticizers, a significant level of leaching from this bag into the extracts of stored platelet concentrates was observed.",
        "The clinical use of novel means of antibiotic administration--continuous infusion, endotracheal instillation and aerosol delivery, peritoneal dialysate, and antibiotic-impregnated catheters, bone cement, and beads--is discussed. Antibiotic infusions have traditionally been administered intermittently, but recent data support the use of continuous infusions in treating gram-negative bacillus bacteremias in neutropenic patients. Local instillation of antibiotics--endotracheally or by aerosols--may be indicated in patients with pulmonary infections and damaged pulmonary-defense systems; in other patients, normal host defenses make local therapy unnecessary. Patients undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis often develop intraperitoneal staphylococcal and streptococcal infections, and these are best treated with antibiotics added directly to the dialysate. Other recent studies support the use of antimicrobial agents in medical devices. Antibiotic-impregnated catheters are being tested as means of preventing difficult-to-treat catheter-related infections. Bone cement containing aminoglycosides has proven useful in preventing deep-bone infections in patients undergoing total-hip arthroplasty, and antibiotic-impregnated beads are useful, along with debridement, in patients with osteomyelitis.

After 11, 25, and 39 days in situ, explants from animals injected with GAX collagen demonstrated greater wet-weight persistence than all other materials. Conversely, at all time points, the explants of Atelocollagen were the least persistent. Following 25 days in vivo, explants were examined using differential scanning calorimetry; ZCI and Atelocollagen displayed thermal transition temperatures of 58 degrees C. Avitene and Gelfoam explants displayed transition points of 30 degrees C and 32 degrees C, indicating denatured or cleaved collagen.

With respect to immunogenicity, day 39 sera from ZCI treated animals showed significantly lower titers in the ELISA to their respective implant collagen than all other groups examined, while antibody activity in the GAX collagen, Gelfoam, Atelocollagen, and intact collagen groups were not significantly different. Collastat elicited antibodies with a greater affinity than observed in these previous groups.

        "Phthalate esters are the most extensively used plasticizers in the manufacture of polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastic. Many medical devices used in the collection and storage of blood components are made of PVC plastic containing di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). DEHP leaches at a rate of 100 micrograms/ml X d into platelet concentrate (PC) supernatant when PCs are stored in PVC containers. It is only possible to store PCs for 72 h in this DEHP plastic, after which time the platelet function has deteriorated and they cannot be used for transfusion therapy. Since it was desirable to find a container that permitted longer storage times and because of the concern for the toxicity of DEHP, new bags, manufactured with different plastic formulations without this plasticizer, were tested for PC storage. Using these new containers, such as the PL732 [polyolefin (PO) plastic], and the CLX300 and PL1240 [tri(2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TEHTM) PVC plastic], it was possible to store PCs for 5 d while preserving platelet function. In spite of these new plastic bags being manufactured without DEHP, we found DEHP and its metabolite mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) as contaminants of the supernatant of the PCs stored in these containers. After analyzing the plastic material of each of these containers, we were able to identify the source of the contamination as coming from the plastic materials that were used in the manufacture of the bags. The sterilization process of the PL732 bag was investigated, since it was found that when the plastic of the PL732 bag was analyzed prior to sterilization, no contamination by DEHP was detected; however, whether the PL732 bag was sterilized together with the primary PVC bag or separately, using ethylene oxide, contamination by DEHP was found, suggesting contamination of the sterilization unit by DEHP.",

Since the election in 1985 that returned Brazil to democratic rule, the government has taken active steps to address many of these problems. The example of Brazil is important for all of the developing world to examine and follow, where applicable. In addition, North American and European aid programs could play a much more constructive role in helping less developed countries develop their health care services. International organizations such as the World Health Organization must also be active in assisting such countries to improve their decisions concerning medical technology.\nDeveloping countries, in attempting to improve their health care systems, must import much technology, and they often lack the expertise to make wise choices.  On site, the technologies are often inexpertly applied, and along with expensive pharmaceuticals, they become a drain on national resources.  Medical literature is often hard to obtain.  This article examines the case of Brazil, which has shared many of the problems of other developing countries, including inadequate access of the population to health services, due in large part to a maldistribution of resources and wealth in general, and heavy private-sector control of health services.  Other problems include maldistribution and excessive use of technology, a relatively weak national industry for production of drugs and medical devices, a weak policy structure for dealing with medical technology, and little tradition of using research or policy analysis as a guide to action.

        "Anaphylatoxin radioimmunoassay techniques have been employed to define both the temporal profile and the amount of complement activation taking place in two different types of extracorporeal circuits. Prospective studies of patients undergoing both maintenance hemodialysis and cardiopulmonary bypass provided essentially similar findings. In both cases, plasma C3a antigen levels proved to be the most accurate and sensitive indicator of intravascular complement activation. By contrast, plasma C5a levels varied little during the period of extracorporeal circulation. Instead, this anaphylatoxin retained considerable biologic activity in vivo as evidenced by its ability to promote granulocyte activation and transient granulocytopenia which was displayed by patients in both groups. Plasma levels of C4a antigen were not elevated during the period of extracorporeal circulation, suggesting that alternative pathway mechanisms were predominantly responsible for the complement activation taking place in both hemodialyzers and bypass oxygenators. However, classical pathway activation events could be documented when protamine sulfate was administered to heparinized patients after cardiopulmonary bypass. In this instance, elevated plasma levels of both C4a and C3a antigens were observed. Prospective studies also suggested that complement activation could be associated with the development of both acute and delayed clinical sequelae. Available data support the hypothesis that C5a anaphylatoxin might be the primary mediator of these undesirable effects of extracorporeal circulation. These types of investigations have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of the anaphylatoxins in human disease and may be directly applied to facilitate design of more biocompatible medical devices.",

        "The adherence of coagulase-negative staphylococci to smooth surfaces was assayed by measuring the optical densities of stained bacterial films adherent to the floors of plastic tissue culture plates. The optical densities correlated with the weight of the adherent bacterial film (r = 0.906; P less than 0.01). The measurements also agreed with visual assessments of bacterial adherence to culture tubes, microtiter plates, and tissue culture plates. Selected clinical strains were passed through a mouse model for foreign body infections and a rat model for catheter-induced endocarditis. The adherence measurements of animal passed strains remained the same as those of the laboratory-maintained parent strain. Spectrophotometric classification of coagulase-negative staphylococci into nonadherent and adherent categories according to these measurements had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 90.6, 80.8, and 88.4%, respectively. We examined a previously described collection of 127 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from an outbreak of intravascular catheter-associated sepsis; strains associated with sepsis were more adherent than blood culture contaminants and cutaneous strains (P less than 0.001). We also examined a collection of 84 strains isolated from pediatric patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts; once again, pathogenic strains were more adherent than were CSF contaminants (P less than 0.01). Finally, we measured the adherence of seven endocarditis strains. As opposed to strains associated with intravascular catheters and CSF shunts, endocarditis strains were less adherent than were saprophytic strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci. The optical densities of bacterial films adherent to plastic tissue culture plates serve as a quantitative model for the study of the adherence of coagulase-negative staphylococci to medical devices, a process which may be important in the pathogenesis of foreign body infections.",

        "In summary, rapidly growing mycobacteria, M. fortuitum and M. chelonei, are pathogens of increasing importance which are often hospital-acquired and can infect patients with iatrogenic immunosuppression. They readily grow on routine mycobacterial culture media and must be distinguished from non-pathogenic rapidly growing species and slowly growing mycobacteria. Widely distributed in nature, they are often present in hospital environments, especially in water. Compared to M. tuberculosis they are weak pathogens, and infected patients are not considered contagious. Disease is probably acquired from environmental sources by direct entry of the organisms through traumatized skin or mucous membranes or by aspiration into previously abnormal lungs. They are usually resistant to antituberculous agents but are susceptible to several commonly used antibacterial agents. Treatment generally requires one or more active antibiotics plus adjunctive surgery in many cases. Prevention of nosocomial infection lies in proper disinfection of potentially contaminated medical devices and elimination of contaminated water.",

        "Methods of assessing the biocompatibility of materials for use in medical devices were evaluated. Ten materials were tested using quantitative, objectively graded in vitro biochemical and functional assays employing four cell lines (CCL 1, 74, 76, and 131) used in previous work and five primary cell types (human lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and mixed leukocytes, mouse macrophages, and mouse embryo). The biochemical methods (DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, and ATP activity) demonstrated good agreement in toxicity ranking of the materials, regardless of which cell culture was used and, also, the cell cultures responded similarly for each method. Methods that measured functional characteristics of cells (adhesion and phagocytosis) were highly sensitive but had low toxicity ranking agreement and reproducibility. Assays (defined as method and cell culture combinations) using cell lines were more reproducible than assays using primary cell types. Significant differences in sensitivity were noted among the assay systems for particular material types. The in vitro assays were more sensitive to differences in material composition than was a 90-day assay by subcutaneous implantation in rats.",

Seven teams from around the United States are participating in this investigation as coinvestigators with the House Ear Institute. The clinical research program involves evaluation and selection for an implant surgery, basic guidance for fitting the device, and follow-up monitoring on a regular basis. As of December 31, 1984, 164 profoundly deaf children have received the cochlear implant. They ranged in age at time of surgery from 2 yr, 5 mo to 17 yr, 11 mo. The majority of children were deafened from bacterial meningitis (N = 98). The pertinent issues involved in the implantation of children include methods of investigation, impact of deafness, potential risks and benefits, and alternatives.

This review summarizes the means by which LAL reagent suppliers have introduced different production techniques and formulation additives to uniquely optimize their products for industry. Pharmaceutical testing requires a LAL reagent that is buffered, stabilized to a sensitivity of 0.12 EU/ml, optimized to detect E. coli-derived LPS in water, formulated to produce firm opaque gels, designed specifically to detect bacterial endotoxin, and is economical. Unique LAL reagent characteristics produce nonuniformity in drug compatibility testing but does not significantly alter detection of unsafe levels of native endotoxin. Design of a clinical LAL reagent may require additional means for standardization and exclusion of additives which are only useful for pharmaceutical testing. A cooperative effort between clinical investigators and the LAL industry should resolve these issues in a reasonable period of time.",

In light of the fact that some medical practitioners view an appliance worn internally as a form of medical device, and in light of the recent knowledge about tampons gained during the crisis surrounding Toxic Shock Syndrome, little published information about women's menstrual patterns and practices was found. The data used here were provided by 470 members of the Endometriosis Association. These respondents' medical, surgical, and fertility case histories are stored in the Association's Data Registry housed at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Cases in this study are white; the average age is 31 +/- 5.2 years and 82 percent report use of tampons routinely. In contrast, general rates of tampon use, derived historically from several published studies using control groups matched to cases of Toxic Shock Syndrome were used for comparison. Results showed that rates of tampon use for women with endometriosis were similar to rates reported for the general population, 75 to 83 percent. We did find that within this group of mature white women, initiation of tampon use varied by age. Supporting Irwin and Millstein's study of tampon use in adolescent girls, an analysis of variance showed these women initiated tampon use at progressively earlier ages (p less than 0.001).",

        "The experimental procedure described is designed to allow calculation of the radiation sterilization dose for medical devices to any desired standard of sterility assurance. The procedure makes use of the results of a series of sterility tests on device samples exposed to doses of radiation from 0.2 to 1.8 Mrad in 0.2 Mrad increments. From the sterility test data a 10(-2) sterility level dose is determined. A formula is described that allows a value called DS Mrad to be calculated. This is an estimate of the effective radiation resistance of the heterogeneous microbial population remaining in the tail portion of the inactivation curve at the 10(-2) dose and above. DS Mrad is used as a D10 value and is applied, in conjunction with the 10(-2) sterility level dose, to an extrapolation factor to estimate a sufficient radiation sterilization dose. A computer simulation of the substerilization process has been carried out. This has allowed an extensive evaluation of the procedure, and the sterilization dose obtained from calculation to be compared with the actual dose required. Good agreement was obtained with most microbial populations examined, but examples of both overdosing and underdosing were found with microbial populations containing a proportion of organisms displaying pronounced shoulder inactivation kinetics. The method allows the radiation sterilization dose to be derived from the natural resistance of the microbial population to gamma sterilization.",

This study was performed to determine the extent of the problem and the cause(s) of the loosening connections. Of 45 hospitals responding to the survey, 15 reported a total of 25 melted plugs. Terminal torques were measured on the plugs of ninety-nine randoMly selected medical devices; 21% of the inspected torques measured zero in-lbs. Static mechanical tests were performed on the plug terminals of five manufacturers. A maximum decrease in torque of 18% was noted over a 6-month period.

Loosening torques appear to be more frequently associated with appliances requiring high currents and those that are frequently inserted and withdrawn from receptacles. It is concluded that a serious problem exists with loosened terminals in hospital-grade plugs.

        "Medical technology, which holds out the promise of improving public health, is obviously important.  Nevertheless, it is also true that in some ways today's medical technology seems out of control.  In the US, for example, there has been investment in curative technology even beyond the point where one could hope for small gains, while many possibilities in other areas of health technology have been ignored.  Therefore, the important question is how to develop, select, and deploy medical technology that will meet human needs without overtaxing our countries' limited resources.  In general, there are 4 types of government policies dealing with medical technology, these being research and development policies, evaluation policies, safety and efficacy policies, and policies governing investments and use.  By and large, the nations of Latin America tend to be in need of clearly defined health research policies and of improved coordination and communication between institutions doing applied research.  I very important research and development question that has not been clearly answered is whether existing resources can be used to produce a more appropriate technology, for in general the region's limited scientific research effort has not been steered in this direction.  Regarding evaluation of medical technology, it appears that no Latin American country has as explicit policy or program concerned with the evaluation of medical technology.  In the area of safety and efficacy, the mandatory registration of new pharmaceuticals with the government usually provides a basis for regulation of pharmaceutical technology in Latin America.  The nature of this registration process varies greatly from country to country, and in most countries except Brazil, little or no original testing is prformed.  Medical devices are not generally regulated for safety of efficacy in Latin America.  Regarding investment in medical technologies ad the use of those technologies, a large share of the health services in Latin America is provided through public programs.  This means that the decisions to invest in and use certain technologies are not dictated by the individuals who wish to use the services, but rather are made by those controlling the systems, often through explicit policies.  Ideally, a well coordinated system for assessing medical technology can be broken down into 4 stages:  identification of the technologies to be assessed, testing of those technologies, synthesis of all available information, and dissemination of that information to appropriate properties.  At the present time, there is little indication that any of these processes are being preformed in an extensive way in most Latin American countries.  However, many cases, it would appear possible to have a program which identified technologies in urgent need of assessment, sought information from various sources, and prepared guidelines for action based on this information.  This would not be expensive but could be rather useful.",

        "The history of the drug approval process in the United States includes three phases. First, the Food and Drug Act of 1906 essentially required that the labeling of drugs be truthful. The 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act added a requirement that drugs be proven safe, and the 1962 act added the requirement that drugs be efficacious. Each of these steps required more and more sophisticated science. Subsequent to the Kefauver-Harris Amendments of 1962, the number of innovative molecular entities each year has declined, the reasons for which have been subject to great debate. This decline has paralleled decreases in innovation across almost all American industry, leading to questions about the future of our country as an industrialized society. Both the Carter and Reagan administrations attempted to address this problem in a number of ways, including cutting back on those regulations that are perceived as unnecessary. Other innovative approaches have been used, such as the establishment of an Office of Small Manufacturers Assistance in the FDA Bureau of Medical Devices, mandated by the 1976 Medical Device Amendments. The latter came about in recognition of the fact that small businesses tend to be more creative and efficient than larger industries and more adversely affected by regulation. However, the problems raised in the regulation of technology transfer almost inevitably arise because of perceived scientific questions. Such questions, in turn, can only be answered by good science performed by the sponsor and understood by the regulator. Thus, it is essential that the FDA be staffed with knowledgeable scientists who can interact easily with their peers in academia and industry.

Prosthesis implantation is a promising surgical treatment of intractable esophageal reflux, but we believe additional and long-term studies are needed before its general use.",

Other major concerns include prepurchase evaluation opportunity, repair capabilities, breakdown frequency, capability for emergency repair, self-monitoring systems built into equipment, personnel education on the use of the equipment, other services offered by the company, trade-in capability, reliability of the company, and restrictions established by the Hospital's Standardization committee. The Emergency Care Research Institute is considered to be the \"consumer's guide\" for sophisticated hospital equipment and issues a publication called Health Devices, which reviews the results of their findings.

        "This article provides background and discusses the purposes of the Medical Device Amendments to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1976, which gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the responsibility of protecting the public from unsafe and ineffective medical devices.  The FDA is authorized to ensure that devices are safe and effective both before and during marketing, and must classify all medical devices for human use into 1 of 3 regulatory categories based on the extent of control necessary to assure their safety and effectiveness:  Class I, General Controls; Class II, Performance Standards, and Class III, Premarket Approval.  Panels of experts including 1 nonvoting representative each of industry and consumers will continue until all devices are classified.  Device manufacturers are required to register and list their products, and there is a premarket notification requirement applicable to manufacturers of all postamendment devices.  Under certain circumstances the FDA is authorized to ban devices, order manufacturers, importers, or distributors to repair or replace devices presenting unreasonable health risks, or restrict the sale, distribution, or use of a device.  The FDA promulgates regulations requiring conformity with good manufacturing practice regulations and can regulate color additives and develop performance standards for Class II devices.  The development of a device and collection of data necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness may occur simultaneously, in which case a Product Development Protocol must be submitted to the FDA.  Devices intended solely for investigational use and custom devices may be exempt from some requirements.  In most cases the amendments preempt state and local requirements.  Imported devices must comply with FDA regulations.  The Office of Small Manufacturers Assistance has been established to assist small manufacturers in complying with the act.  Greater cooperation with medical practitioners would be highly desirable in the regulation of medical devices.",
        "This study estimates the economic cost of diabetes mellitus in Sweden 1978. It also addresses the question of potential savings from improved metabolic control. Economic costs of illness include direct costs for medical care and indirect costs from lost production due to morbidity and premature death. The total costs of diabetes are estimated at 1300 million SEK in Sweden 1978. The direct costs for medical care accounted for 43% of these costs. Lost production due to permanent disability is the dominating indirect costs, and accounts for 60% of indirect costs and one third of the total costs. Institutional care accounts for two thirds of the direct costs. The costs for drugs and medical devices amount to 128 million SEK or 1000 SEK per insulin- or oraldependent diabetic. Costs for control of diabetes are estimated to 20% of the total cost and 50% of direct costs. The conclusion is that there are great potential benefits to be expected from improved self control of diabetes.",
        "An overview of the impact of the FDA's investigational device regulation on the field of the cochlear implants has been presented. It can be seen that the regulation has been established to provide a legal framework for conducting clinical investigations with medical devices. The regulation incorporates the concepts of institutional review and the informed consent of the patient. These concepts are not new; they have existed for a long time as part of medical research in the United States. We believe that the institutional review board will serve to effectively review and monitor the clinical course of patients receiving cochlear implants. We also believe that we have developed a regulation that maximizes patient safety, while encouraging investigation of the device. We understand and appreciate that IRB monitoring is far more efficient and effective than having FDA personnel on hand at various institutions around the country to monitor investigational studies. We know full well the added complexity that a bureaucratic monitoring process can bring to a clinical investigation. We think that the IRB approach is the most direct, straightforward, protective, and cost-effective approach that can be taken. We appreciate the benefit that a patient receives in having a competent and expert investigator. The regulations were written to rely on these investigators for expertise in their particular specialty in conducting and evaluating the clinical studies. We recognize the role of the sponsor, who has made a commitment to the improvement of health care through advancement in technology, and who seeks to restore or to produce some degree of hearing for the totally deaf. Without a sponsor, these studies would not be possible. And last, but not least, we recognize the all-important role of the patient, who provides the clinical data base. The patient's welfare and safety must be considered in any clinical study. The IDE regulation has been in effect since July 1980. It provides the opportunity for the FDA and the medical and scientific communities to work together for the success of medical-device investigations. We can all pride ourselves on our high standard of medical excellence. When we can work together, this standard will rise even higher.",
        "For 30 years polyester textile materials in tubular form have been used in vascular surgery for the replacement and by-pass of arteries. Initially such medical devices were implanted to maintain the distal blood flow of atherosclerotic patients for a number of months. Today, with prognoses in excess of 10 or 15 years, and with implantation in younger and younger patients, this particular end use is possibly one of the most demanding applications for a textile product. The paper describes the current manufacturing techniques and provides detailed information about the wide variety of filaments, yarns and fabrics used in the production of current commercial devices. By reviewing the mechanical and clinical performance of available designs against the criteria of an 'ideal' prosthesis, the objective of this paper is to assist surgeons in making clinical decisions, to provide the textile and medical products industries with directions for future design improvements, and to support standards writers in their formidable task of establishing a rational standard for vascular repair devices.",

Eight groups of pregnant rats were exposed to a magnetic field strength of 55 amps/meter and an electric field strength of 300 volts/meter on gestation days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, or 15. Exposures ceased once the dam's colonic temperature reached 43.0 degrees C (about 20-40 minutes' duration). Eight matching control groups were sham-irradiated for 30 minutes at 0 amps/meter and 0 volts/meter. An additional group of pregnant rats received no treatment. With one exception, no significant differences occurred between sham-irradiated and untreated control groups. RF exposure, however, caused a significant incidence of fetal malformations throughout the postimplantation period (days 7 through 15). It also caused a low but significant incidence of preimplantation malformations. Fetal weight and crown-rump length were reduced in all postimplantation exposure groups but were not affected by preimplantation exposure. The incidence of dead or resorbed fetuses was significantly increased in rats irradiated on days 7 or 9. The effects observed appeared to be caused by RF-induced hyperthermia in the treated dams. Since a number of industrial, scientific, and medical devices operating at or near 27.12 MHz can cause hyperthermia in humans, women of childbearing age should avoid exposure to RF-radiation levels that exceed current US occupational standards.",

The Gunn rat was used because it has a negligible activity of UDP glucuronosyltransferase toward bilirubin and certain other aglycones. Cyclohexanone was administered iv for 28 consecutive days to Wistar and Gunn rats in two doses (50 and 100 mg/kg), using solutions containing 0.25 and 0.50 g per 100 ml, respectively, at a constant volume of 20 mg/kg. Saline (0.9% NaCl) was used as the control. Daily observations for signs of toxicity showed no adverse effects in Wistar or Gunn rats injected with either dose. Daily weight changes of control and test animals were similar. Ophthalmologic examinations revealed no treatment-related structural lesions. No adverse effects were noted when the data from the hemogram or clinical chemistry parameters were evaluated. Gross pathological and histopathologic assessment showed no alterations due to cyclohexanone treatment. Urinary excretions of total and glucuronide conjugates of cyclohexanol were similar for Wistar and Gunn rats; less than 1% was excreted as free cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. It is concluded that the Gunn rat is capable of forming glucuronides of cyclohexanol and that cyclohexanone at these doses has a negligible toxic potential.",
        "External surfaces of packaging materials used for sterile medical devices may introduce contaminants into working areas used for sterility testing. Light wiping with tissues moistened with alkaline 2% glutaraldehyde (Cidex) or 3% hydrogen peroxide effectively reduced counts on 5 X 8 cm strips of packaging material (Tyvek) inoculated with 10(7) spores of Bacillus subtilis. The ability of antimicrobial agents to penetrate packaging material and kill contaminants on the medical device was tested by inoculating filter membranes with ca 100 cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus or ca 100 spores of Bacillus subtilis. A sterile square of test packaging material placed over the inoculated membrane (direct method) or 0.5 cm above the membrane (indirect method) was wiped with the antimicrobial agent. Except for polyethylene film (3 mil), all materials tested, including glassine and several types of coated and uncoated Tyvek, were penetrated by the agents, killing cells on the inoculated membranes. Death rates varied, depending on the organism, packaging material, and testing method.

In a recent outbreak of S. epidermidis intravascular catheter-associated sepsis, we noted that 63% of clinically implicated strains grew as a slimy film coating the culture tube walls when propagated in tryptic soy broth. Only 37% of randomly collected blood culture contaminants and skin isolates demonstrated a similar phenomenon (p less than 0.05). Transmission electron micrographs of these coating bacteria showed them to be encased in an extracellular matrix that stained with alcian blue. Slime production was most evident in autoclaved media containing Casamino Acids and glucose supplementation (0.25% wt/vol). There were strain and media preparation variability of slime production in the presence of other carbohydrates. Some strains were not able to produce slime under any of the tested conditions. The production or nonproduction of slime did not influence growth rate. When grown in vitro, slime producers accumulated on the surface of intravascular catheters as macrocolonies, whereas non-slime, producers did not. Transmission and scanning electron micrographs showed slime producers to be encased in an adhesive layer on the catheter surface, whereas nonproducers were not encased. These results suggest that slime-mediated adherence may be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of S. epidermidis infections of medical devices.",
        "For the sterilization of disposable medical devices, ethylene oxide gas is used in most cases. When this sterilization method is used, ethylene oxide (EO) and its secondary products, i.e., ethylene chlorohydrin (ECH) and ethylene glycol (EG), remain in the medical devices after sterilization. If their concentration is high, these residues are liable to cause hemolytic activity and dermal or mucous membrane irritability in the human body. For this reason, in 1978 the FDA announced a proposal to regulate the residual limits of EO, ECH and EG. Our studies were done to examine the conditions of EO sterilization from the viewpoints of the sterilization effect and the residual chemical substances and to find the optimum conditions for sterilization. Further, the aerator was fabricated for the exclusive purpose of reducing, within a brief period, the concentration of EO and other substances remaining in the medical devices after sterilization and we examined the condition of aeration by using this aerator. As the result, it was found that a satisfactory sterilization effect could be obtained under the sterilization conditions of an EO gas concentration of 500 mg/liter, a sterilizing temperature of 55 to 60 degrees C and a sterilizing time of two hours, and under these conditions the concentration of the residual substances such as the EO could be made comparatively lower. It was also clarified that the minimum required aeration conditions by using the exclusive-use aerator were a temperature of 55 to 60 degrees C and an aeration time of 24 hours and over.",

Other relevant areas, such as patents, liability, and taxation, are discussed more briefly. In 1976 legislation authorized the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require manufacturers of medical devices to show that their products meet acceptable levels of safety and effectiveness. FDA has classified each device into one of three classes according to the extent of regulation needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Although all devices must conform to general manufacturing controls and some to premarketing approval, no performance standards have yet been developed. About two-thirds of all expenditures for medical care in the United States are paid by private or public insurers. Although procedures vary for institutional and individual providers, payment is usually made after the medical care has been provided and covers the provider's costs or charges. Prevailing insurance coverage and payment methods contain incentives for the innovation and use of medical devices that are part of mainstream medical care. At the same time, these financial arrangements discourage preventive and rehabilitative devices, which are generally excluded from insurance coverage.",

        "The cochlear implant is an electronic auditory prosthesis gaining widespread acceptance as a means of restoring partial hearing to the totally deaf. A number of engineering and biological hurdles remain toward the improvement of existing implantable systems and development of multichannel systems. One hurdle concerns reliable transcutaneous coupling of the external electric signal to the implanted device. To date this has been accomplished by inductive means through coils which were mechanically held in place. The incorporation of small, permanent, rare-earth (SmCo5) magnets with the coil assemblies has eliminated the unreliable mechanical supporting devices. Magnetic attachment was simulated in dogs to examine for biological compatibility. Electron micrographs indicated normal subcellular structures in tissue exposed for 10 weeks. Five patients were implanted with magnet-modified coil assemblies and tested for the proper alignment and support of the external coil assembly, as well as efficiency of inductive coupling. Electromagnetic coupling was not interfered with and mechanical support was adequate. We conclude that rare-earth magnets provide an effective means for supporting and positioning in place medical devices, such as the cochlear implant.",
        "Towels from private homes and public offices and underwear contaminated by being used by employees at a public health laboratory were examined for occurrence of radiation-resistant bacteria and fungi. Three different methods were used for isolation of the most resistant organisms, one with multiplication of the microbial population prior to an irradiation used for selection, and two without this multiplication and with the organisms placed on membrane filters or in situ on the textiles, respectively. A total of 44 different strains were isolated. Differences in the three methods used for selection of the most radiation-resistant microorganisms were not reflected in the results. 16 pigment-producing Gram-positive cocci, tentatively classified as Micrococcus radiodurans, were the most radiation-resistant and were isolated in about half of the examinations. Other Gram-positive cocci, non-spore forming rods, some Nocardia and Candida parapsilosis strains and two Bacillus strains constituted the rest of the collection. Wtih few exceptions dose-response curves for the strains were upward convex. D-6 values were determined to be between 1.5 megarad for the most radiation sensitive, a Candida, and 5.7 megarad for the most resistant,, tentatively classified as M. radiodurans. The D-6 values for the Bacillus strains were in both cases 1.8 megarad, consistent with a D-value of 0.3 megarad. The same resistance is reported to be the maximum resistance for B pumilus, strain E601, commonly used as reference strain in the literature on radiation sterilization of medical devices and supplies.",

        "The control of Radiofrequency (RF) radiation (including microwave radiation) that is emitted by therapeutic medical devices is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Bureau of Radiological Health (BRH). Several studies of RF emissions from various shortwave (27 MHz) and microwave (2450 MHz) diathermy devices have been conducted by the Electromagnetics Branch of the Bureau's Division of Electronic Products. BRH studies have led to a proposed standard for microwave diathermy devices operating above 900 MHz. Shortwave diathermy devices used in physical therapy situations have been found to produce relatively high levels of unintended exposures (sometimes exceeding present U.S. exposure standards) to device operators and to the nonprescribed tissues of the patient. BRH is initiating further studies to ascertain the need for controls to be placed on these shortwave devices to ensure safety and medical effectiveness. Radiation safety standards, which presently exist in the United States, allow much higher unintended human exposures than do the standards existing in the several eastern European countries. A trend to lower permissible exposures to 5 mW/cm2 or even 1 mW/cm2 is under way in the U.S. The various provisions of FDA's Medical Device regulations apply to investigational as well as commercially-marketed RF/microwave devices and require both safety and medical effectiveness aspects of performance to be addressed by their manufacturer.

        "Calcification of glutaraldehyde-treated porcine tissue heart valves (xenografts) is not a unique phenomenon but characteristic of a variety of synthetic elastomers and to a lesser extent of non-elastomeric polymers. The main commonality between them is their relative flexibility, permeability, and porosity, and differing capability to adsorb and to absorb various blood components. Although the possibility of biochemical factors involving calcium homeostasis and vitamin K-dependent protein carboxylation as recently proposed by others should not be ignored, it should be noted that calcification of synthetic elastomers has been reported with or without continuous anticoagulation with coumarin derivatives. This paper presents a physico-chemical view showing that despite the observed calcifications with a small number of xenograft valves, their otherwise impressive performance in the physiological environment is due to a significant extent to thermodynamic, molecular and supramolecular factors. The longevity of glutaraldehyde-treated tissue valves can be further improved by special methods. Calcification is especially characteristic for flexing and otherwise moving and pulsating surfaces, typical of many experimental circulatory assist devices and artificial hearts intended for long-term uses.",

On the initial visit, the woman was presented with information on the cervical cap and its use and was loaned a cap after proper fitting.  After the trial period, the woman returned for follow-up where she could elect to purchase a cap and if so, was then given a questionnaire to be returned later.  The group of 34 women were divided into regular and irregular users: of the 24 regular users, 7 became pregnant using the cap and 2 of the irregular users became pregnant.  9 of the 24 users had 1 or more unwanted pregnancies aborted prior to the use of the cap, and 4 of the 7 regular users who became pregnant while using the cap had a previous pregnancy.  While users were initially motivated, some did not actually use the method properly and even with proper fit, some found the cap became dislodged.  This study did not bear out the high hopes many had for the cap's convenience and effectiveness although 16 or 17 regular users who did not become pregnant did continue use.

The program was instituted to ensure the quality and integrity of the safety data submitted to FDA in support of the approval of regulated products, including human and animal drugs, food additives, biologicals, radiation-emitting products and human medical devices. Moreover, these considerations include all safety data submitted to support applications for research and marketing permits. These steps were taken in response to the appalling circumstances uncovered in a limited series of inspections of laboratories that was performed during 1975. FDA found careless experimentation, improperly trained employees, unreviewed data, omitted data, improper laboratory and animal care procedures and improperly monitored contract studies, including the failure of sponsors to validate the data appearing in the final study reports.

Responsibility for adhering to the standards is divided between the manufacturer, who is forbidden to make a profit from clinical trials, the clinical investigator, and the Institutional Review Board.  Implants intended to remain in the body 30 days or more are specifically included as significant risk devices, and this ruling will affect research on many devices designed to be implanted in the fallopian tubes and vas deferens and on IUDs not containing physiologically active components.  Many contraceptive devices besides implants are affected, as are all instruments and most reagents used in prenatal diagnostic testing.

There is a proportional decrease in leachability of DEHP but not of H-200 as the plasma proteins are diluted. Saline extracts of DEHP demonstrated a low but progressive rate of leaching with an accumulation of 11 microgram/ml after seven weeks whereas H-200 showed only a constant residue of 0.35 microgram/ml. Normal human serum incubated for three weeks at 37 C with PVC strips plasticized with DEHP produced significant growth-inhibition of human diploid fibroblasts. Human serum incubated in an identical manner with PVC plasticized with H-200 for up to four weeks demonstrated no effect on tissue culture. These studies indicate that H-200 deserves further evaluation as a replacement for DEHP in PVC biomedical devices.",

        "This paper details efforts to define the primary pathophysiology of acute smoke inhalation without the variables of infection, burns, or fluid resuscitation. A standard dose of smoke (wood and kerosene) was delivered at 37 C to mongrel dogs. The parameters studied included blood gases, carboxyhemoglobin, pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics, respiratory mechanics, surface tension area curves as an indication of surfactant activity, and in vivo photomicroscopy. The FiO2 of the smoke was 17 volumes per cent; the carbon monoxide 17,000 ppm. Immediately following smoke exposure, dense, nonsegmental atelectasis developed. Hemodynamic changes were insignificant, but the PaO2 fell to 49 mmHg; the right to left shunt rose from 5 to 41%. Surfactant reduction was significant: enough to cause an increase in the minimum surface tension from 7 to 22 dynes/cm. This surfactant loss may explain the atelectasis seen and the marked instability of subpleural alveolar walls. The data collected are consistent and support the acute inactivation of surfactant as one of the primary pathophysiologic events in smoke inhalation. The clinical correlation is good; surfactant loss may explain why victims of smoke inhalation are so vulnerable to fluid administration if they have thermal burns as well effectiveness of medical devices.",
        "The design and development of comparative quantitative procedures for evaluating the safety and biocompatibility of plastics to be used in medical and para-medical fields, are important considerations. The increasing number of applications for plastic devices requires inquiry into the value of present evaluation procedures and into the possibilities of improving them. Tests designed to establish the safety of a plastic as a simple transfusion apparatus may be completely unsuitable for testing the potential toxicity of large amounts of plastic tubing used in extracorporeal circulation. Tests for detecting the presence of toxic substances that could migrate from a plastic container into a drug solution provide only a limited evaluation of the toxic potential of plastics to be used in prolonged direct contact with blood and other tissues and may not be acceptable for final determination of the safety of a plastic implant. This could only be accomplished with long-term animal implant studies in vivo in conjunction with limited human experimentation. Biocompatibility as a concept is still fairly recent and definitive biocompatibility tests remain to be developed. The importance of a producer's declaration of the components of any given plastic and of submitting plastic equipment to experiments pertaining to the practical use of the material, is stressed. The urgent need for both short- and long-term toxicological investigations of the components of plastic medical devices in individuals with normal as well as in individuals with abnormal elimination capacity, is emphasized.",

Epidemics of device-related infections appear to have increased in frequency since 1965, have been due mainly to gram-negative bacilli, usually have resulted from in-hospital contamination of devices, and most often have been linked to urinary catheters, intravenous infusion devices, hemodialysis, and respiratory therapy equipment. Endemic device-related infections include those traced to these same commonly used medical devices as well as infections that follow use of specialized devices such as prostheses.

However, research efforts have recently made available alternative procedures to test for pyrogens which may have significant value in quality control. Part of the reluctance to accept tests other than the rabbit test may be due to the low visibility of emerging understanding of a significant theory of testing in which it is contended that the parameters of sensitivity and specificity are inversely related and that accuracy is an ideal. The rabbit pyrogen assay will detect 1 to 10 ng of enterobacteriaceal endotoxin (ET). The limulus test will detect 0.01 to 0.1 ng/ml of ET; some of the other tests approach the rabbit assay in sensitivity. Since it is current dogma that pyrogen is equivalent to ET, the basis for the use of ET to standardize pyrogen tests is rationalized. The source of ET in practice is bacterial contamination; therefore, numbers of bacteria that contaminate parenteral preparations can be directly related to potential pyrogenicity. Further, viable counts of bacteria in parenteral preparations, prior to sterilization, is a reliable test for pyrogens. Other tests such as nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and actinomycin-D enhancement of lethality of pyrogen for mice deserve consideration in quality control procedures. The limulus test, the most practical of currently available alternative tests for detection of ET and therefore, of pyrogen has application where the rabbit test cannot be used.

Reduction in remote site infections occurring in surgical patients is necessary to reduce the incidence of surgical wound infections, suggest preventive and control measures, and document the effectiveness of such measures.",

        "Recent experimental studies in Japan on the evaluation of potential health hazards from phthalate esters used in manufacturing poly (vinyl chloride) as well as several plastics for medical devices and for food containers and packages were introduced. Development of pulmonary granuloma formation after intravenous injection of diethylhexyl phthalate was assumed to be dependent on the particle size of the phthalate in vehicle used. Dietary administration of large amount of diethylhexyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate produced renal cysts in mothers and in descendants in reproduction studies in mice. Cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of the phthalates and several plastics and resins were also examined by in vivo and in vitro studies. Hematological parameters examined in rabbits after repeated intravenous injection of diethylhexyl phthalate and after implantation of plastics in aorta for 3--6 months did not show any significant change. A slow decrease of radioactivity was observed in adipose tissue of rats following oral administration of 14C-labeled diethylhexyl phthalate. tthe administrative action on phthalates by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare is briefly reviewed.",
        "The development of statutes to regulate the safety and efficacy of medical devices has been proceeding rapidly. The protection of the consumer from dangerous and ineffective devices is obviously necessary and must be carried out rapidly and efficiently. The electrical shock hazard in prevalence and violence is a case in point. There is no question that many devices are not well made and not suited for the function for which they are sold. These must be controlled, but at the same time we must be careful not to destroy the private research and development efforts which are producing reliable instrumentation through over control and regulation.",

A survey of the national and international standards writing bodies is presented, along with an introduction to related organizations and agencies and nomenclature. The intent of this review is to provide the neurosurgeon with a reference source regarding past and present neurosurgical activities in the materials and devices field. When President Ford signed the 1976 Medical Device Amendments on May 28, 1976, the Food and Drug Administration assumed direct legal authority to control medical devices and potentially assumed the power to regulate those professionals using them.",

        "Spirometry should be more widely used in routine examinations. Equipment should meet the individual physician's or hospital's needs and include either a dependable water-sealed spirometer or an easily calibrated and accurate electronic spirometer. Justifiable concern over the reliability of electronic spirometers has resulted in requests to determine performance standards for these medical devices. Predicted normal standards must apply to the particular spirometer. Recommended tests are those of vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV(1)), the ratio of one-second forced expiratory flow (FEF200-1200) and forced midexpiratory flow (FEF25-75 percent). The maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) test may be useful for evaluation of work disability and detection of extrathoracic obstruction. Additional consideration may be given to measurements of total lung capacity (TLC) to discriminate between restrictive and obstructive impairment and the forced end-expiratory flow (FEF75-85 percent) to detect mild small airway obstruction. At this time, flow-volume curves measurement cannot be justified for routine clinical use.",

        "The biocompatibility of a wide variety of biomaterials was quantitatively assessed, in a physiologically normal environment\" as to cytotoxicity induced in WI-38 cells by cell culture medium extracts. Materials tested included PVC plastic, rubber, silicone rubber, polyethylene, polypropylene, acetal, polyurethane, Teflon, nylon, epoxy, and polystyrene. Cell culture test results were correlated to U.S.P. animal tests. Potential test artifacts, lead, barium, cadmium, and endotoxin were tested for cytotoxicity in WI-38 cells. Cell culture methods yielded more positive tests, particularly rubber, PVC plastic and silicone rubber compounds, than observed in U.S.P. animal tests. Positivity in animal tests did not correlate quantitatively to cytotoxic titers in cell culture. Discrepancies between cell cultures tests and animal tests, specifically rubber compounds, were attributable, in some instances, to differentials in elution efficiency between saline, cottonseed oil, and complete MEM cell culture medium. In other instances, particularly PVC plastics, differences between cell culture and animal test results were due to an inherent difference in the two indicator systems to respond to specific toxic moieties.",

        "Better communication between physicians and manufacturers of medical devices is becoming increasingly important due to wider usage of these devices, as well as more intense scrutiny by consumer interest groups. Physicians should therefore have more complete knowledge of techniques of new product development. A new product typically passes through at least six stages, as follows: (1) idea conception; (2) merit and feasibility study; (3) design and testing; (4) production preparation; (5) market preparation; and (6) marketing. These steps are completed over a period of several years at an ever increasing cost. We propose that interaction procedures be undertaken so as to enhance direct physician-manufacturer communications in the medical device arena. Some possible techniques of improving these communications include the direct training of physicians and manufacturers in each other's problems, the establishment of hospital engineering groups, the placement of medical consultants in industry, and the active participation in device standards-generating groups and other groups of mutual interest.",

        "The history of medical device regulation began with the need to rid the marketplace of bogus inventions which were either harmful in themselves or harmful because they delayed meaningful treatment of illness. Since World War II, sophistication in medical technology and development of electronic and other types of medical devices has created a new need for regulation of safety and performance of devices used to cure and mitigate disease in man. The 1938 amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act gave FDA authority over labeling and advertising of devices, enforceable only after devices were marketed. In 1969 a study by an HEW commission documented the need for further legislation. The commission recommended three categories of medical devices: those requiring premarket clearance or scientific review, those for which standards could be established to protect the public, and those which are generally recognized as safe and for which nor standards would be necessary. In 1974 the Senate unanimously approved Senator Kennedy's \"Medical Device Amendments of 1973\" legislation which fulfills the recommendations of the HEW commission report. The House of Representatives failed to pass their version of the legislation in the 93rd Congress. Senator Kennedy re-introduced the bill in the 94th Congress and it passed the Senate in April 1975. Representative Rogers re-introduced an amended bill. The bill is expected to become law in 1975.",
