<div align="left">FFRDCs are Federally Funded Research and Development Centers.</div>
		
<div style="text-indent:20px;text-align:left">National estimates of funds spent on the performance of research and development by the four major sectors of the economy have been made by the National Science Foundation since 1953.  The data are derived basically from survey responses by performers of research and development (R&amp;D) as to how much they spent on this activity and where their funds originated.  Because of conceptual and practical limitations, the table should be considered as a general approximation rather than an exact statement.</div>
		
<div style="text-indent:20px;text-align:left">R&amp;D consists of basic and applied research in the sciences (including medical sciences) and in engineering and in activities in development, defined later.  R&amp;D excludes routine product testing, quality control, mapping surveys, collection of general-purpose statistics, experimental production, and activities concerned primarily with the dissemination of scientific information and the training of scientific manpower.</div>
		
<div style="text-indent:20px;text-align:left">Basic research, for three of the sectors (federal government, universities and colleges, and other nonprofit institutions), is research directed toward increases of knowledge in science with &ldquo;the primary aim of the investigator being a fuller knowledge or understanding of the subject under study, rather than a practical application thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take account of an individual company's commercial goals, the definition for the industry sector is modified to indicate that basic research projects represent &ldquo;original investigations for the advancement of scientific knowledge&hellip;which do not have specific commercial objectives, although they may be in fields of present or potential interest to the reporting company.&rdquo;</div>
		
<div style="text-indent:20px;text-align:left">The NSF survey concept of development may be summarized as &ldquo;the systematic use of scientific knowledge directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems or methods, including design and development of prototypes and processes.&rdquo;</div>
		
<div style="text-indent:20px;text-align:left">The four-sector division followed by the NSF attempts to take into account both the legal nature and major functions of organizations active in financing and performing basic research, applied research, and development.  However, grouping diverse types of organizations into discrete sectors requires certain arbitrary judgments because of the mixed nature of many organizations, particularly those in the university and other nonprofit sectors.</div>
		
<div style="text-indent:20px;text-align:left">Expenditure levels for academic and federal government performers are in reference to calendar years.  These levels are approximations based on fiscal-year data.  For federal government expenditures starting in 1977, the calendar-year approximation is equal to 75 percent of the amount reported in the same fiscal year plus 25 percent of the amount reported in the subsequent fiscal year.  For academic expenditures in all years and for federal government expenditures prior to 1977, the respective percentages are 50 and 50 because those fiscal years (for most academic institutions and the federal government before 1977) begin on July 1 instead of October 1.</div>
		
<div align="left">
<b>Series Cg114, Series Cg132, Series Cg150, and Series Cg168</b>.  Industry sources of industry R&amp;D expenditures include all nonfederal sources of industry R&amp;D expenditures.</div>
		
<div align="left">
<b>Series Cg118, Series Cg136, Series Cg154, and Series Cg172</b>.  Because of limitations in the survey information, data on nonfederal government funding to other performers are not available and are consequently included in other sectors' support for their own R&amp;D performance.  For example, nonfederal government support to nonprofits is included in nonprofits' support for their own R&amp;D.</div>
